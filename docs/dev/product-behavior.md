# Product Behavior

The user-facing surface of Kanna: task workflows, close semantics, sidebar
state, the diff viewer, keyboard shortcuts, and preferences. Read this when
changing UI flows or task lifecycle behavior.

For Kanna's purpose, current audience, product principles, decision rights,
and the boundary between current and proposed behavior, start with
[Product Context](product-context.md).

The *contracts* an agent must not break — core concepts, workflow and stage
semantics, and the MCP task-management rule — stay in the repo-root
[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).

### Workflows

**Create a task:**
1. ⇧⌘N → enter prompt (choose an available agent provider)
2. The frontend calls `kanna-server`, which creates the git worktree
   (`{repo}/.kanna-worktrees/task-{uuid}`)
3. …runs `.kanna/config.json` setup scripts if present (e.g., `pnpm install`)
4. …and asks the daemon to spawn the agent CLI in the worktree
5. Agent starts working. User watches in real-time terminal.

**Review and merge:**
1. Agent finishes → task marked as unread (bold in sidebar)
2. User selects task, presses Cmd+D → the general-purpose Diff tab shows all branch changes
3. Optionally Cmd+P → file picker → file tab, Cmd+O → open in IDE, or Cmd+J → shell tab in the worktree
4. Cmd+S → advance the workflow (commit post runs in-session; the pr-stage agent creates the GitHub PR and reports its URL)
5. Human reviews the PR through its preserved PR link, then uses the ordinary task stage-advance action. When the task's pinned workflow ships the `approve` post, that post hands approved work to the merge queue/master; pinned workflows without the post only advance. The workflow's existing single-flight and completion semantics remain unchanged.

**Revisions.** Sending a task back for revision follows these contracts
(engine code: `crates/kanna-server/src/task_creator/{stages,resume}.rs`):

- *Feedback is required — for every caller.* An agent-originated request with
  an empty prompt is refused (400) at the API boundary, before a revision
  round is spent or the review run is closed, so the reviewer can resend its
  findings. Every other caller — the human path included — falls back to the
  terminating run's recorded `feedback`, then to its result `summary`; if
  neither holds anything to act on, preparation is refused rather than
  started empty (and any claimed round is handed back).
- *Agent verdicts are bound to their review run.* The request adapter injects
  the immutable `stage_run` id stamped into the reviewer's spawn context.
  The server refuses a task/run mismatch, a stale or already-finished review
  run, or a missing id on a newly bound run before it closes a review or
  spends a revision round. Pre-binding legacy runs keep their compatibility
  path; an explicit human instruction can still be relayed through the agent
  tool path for recovery.
- *Revisions resume by default, provider-neutrally.* `request_revision`
  reopens the target stage's previous PTY agent session in that run's **own
  worktree** — Claude, Copilot, Codex, and OpenCode all resume when their
  recorded session/transcript preconditions hold (each CLI keys transcripts
  differently; the engine checks the recorded session id against the
  provider's own store and the run's cwd). Antigravity and headless SDK
  sessions cannot resume, and any failed precondition (missing transcript,
  worktree gone, tip diverged from the committed one) falls back to a fresh
  fork — with the reason recorded durably on the replacement run
  (`stage_run.resume_fallback_reason`).
- *Rounds are budgeted.* A workflow's `revision_limit` defaults to **5**
  (`0` = unlimited) and counts only *agent-requested* revisions. Once spent,
  an agent's `request_revision` starts nothing: the review verdict is still
  recorded, the task parks `unread` at its current stage, and the response
  carries `revisionBudget.exhausted: true`. A *human* revision bypasses the
  budget and **resets** the count — but only the budget: it is still subject
  to feedback resolution and every other preparation precondition.
  The human origin is a caller declaration, not authenticated identity, and an
  agent may use it only to relay an explicit human instruction from its
  terminal. The desktop shows the exhausted state but has no reset action.
  This is also the documented recovery when a human decides a task should get
  another pass after an automatic round was consumed incorrectly; no separate
  counter-repair operation exists.
- *The task's terms live in its original prompt and durable delivered-input
  history.* Later review stages assess the branch against the prompt plus the
  owner, manager, and reviewer directives recorded by `kanna_task_inputs`.

**Manual intervention:**
1. Cmd+J → shell tab opens in the task's worktree
2. Run tests, inspect files, debug
3. Close shell → focus returns to agent terminal
4. Type in the agent terminal to send input to the running provider CLI

### Editing a local task file

File previews offer **Edit**, followed by a visible terminal-editor choice.
Preferences → **Terminal Editor Command** pins an installed terminal tool (for
example `nvim` or `emacs -nw`); empty means detect available editors. Commands
accept quoted arguments, without shell expansion. `VISUAL` and `EDITOR` are
hints only when they name a recognized terminal editor. Graphical editors keep
using the separate **IDE Command** / **Open in IDE** action. No editor is bundled
or downloaded, and missing/invalid choices are explained in the picker.

Each editor is a separate daemon-backed terminal, leaving the agent TUI intact.
Use the editor's native save/quit commands; Cmd+S does not save or advance while
an editor tab is active. Use the existing tabs to return to the agent, where
Cmd+S retains its existing stage action. Preview/citation navigation remains
read-only, including `kanna_open_view`.

Switching tasks, hiding a tab, and restarting the app reattach the same session.
A stage change leaves the editor in its original workspace; it never moves into
the new stage. Only committed changes cross stage boundaries. Closing the task
ends all of its editor sessions, including hidden
ones and older workspaces, and loses unsaved buffers. Save and quit first.
An ended/missing editor is not automatically restarted; open it explicitly from
a file preview again. The editor owns buffers and saving. Kanna does not inspect
unsaved buffers or prevent simultaneous agent/human writes.

Editing is local desktop only. Remote previews are labelled read-only and do
not open against matching local paths. Editors in a task transferred away are
not remotely transported or resumed by this integration.

### Viewing a terminal from more than one device

The PTY has one authoritative grid. The terminal viewer that most recently
became the actively viewed task terminal steals sizing: opening the task on a
phone sizes the PTY to the phone's measured viewport, and bringing the desktop
terminal back into view restores the desktop grid. Typing, scrolling, rotation,
keyboard visibility, and resize alone do not change control. Hidden,
backgrounded, or zero-size viewers cannot steal sizing. A reconnect
re-registers and rehydrates from the authoritative snapshot without stealing
control.

**Multi-repo:** Import repos via sidebar. Each repo has its own task list. Cmd+Opt+Up/Down navigates tasks in sidebar order.

### Closing a task (⇧⌘⌫)

Close is refused (409) while the task has open subtasks — close or detach them
first. Otherwise:

1. Kills the agent PTY, shell, and all task editor sessions in the daemon
2. Runs workspace teardown commands best-effort when configured
3. Sets `closed_at` in the DB
4. Snapshots dirty state in each of the task's worktrees with a local `WIP at task close` commit, then removes those worktrees with `git worktree remove --force --force` and prunes worktree registrations
5. Deletes the task's `worktree` table rows but keeps the task row and all branches. Branches are never deleted by close.
6. Selects the next task in the sidebar
7. Tasks with `closed_at` are hidden from the sidebar. The sidebar shows tasks whose `closed_at` is null.

Close also delivers blocker-close instructions to dependent tasks' sessions
and starts dependents the close unblocked. Managers observe the durable
`task.closed` event through `kanna_wait_events`; close does not inject input
into another task's terminal.

On server startup, Kanna reconciles leftovers across all repos, including hidden repos: closed-task worktrees are snapshotted and removed, stale registrations are pruned, and young orphan `task-*` directories without a task row are spared. This bounds registered worktrees by construction to roughly the number of open tasks. The bound matters because each registered git worktree expands sandboxed agent shell spawn profiles; unbounded worktrees can overflow macOS `ARG_MAX` and cause sandboxed shell launches to fail with `E2BIG`.

### Task activity

`activity` is a *display* value that blends two independent dimensions —
what the agent process is doing (`runtimeState`: `busy` | `waiting` | `idle` |
`exited`, the daemon's terminal-state verdict) and whether the latest output
has been read (`readState`: `read` | `unread`). Task detail reports all three;
supervision reads `runtimeState`, because a busy task nobody has read carries
`unread` exactly like a finished one.

| Activity | Meaning | Sidebar display |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `working` | The daemon judges the session busy | italic |
| `idle` | Stopped, and read (or selected) | normal |
| `unread` | Latest output not yet read — finished *or* still busy | bold |

Sidebar order: pinned (manual `pin_order`) → unpinned unblocked tasks grouped
by workflow stage in the repo's `stage_order` (default `pr` → `review` →
`in progress`; unknown stages last), newest first within each group → blocked
(newest first). Subtasks nest under their parents (suppressed while
searching).

### Pinned tasks

Tasks can be pinned to the top of their repo's task list by dragging above the pin divider. Per-repo scope. Closed tasks disappear regardless of pin state.

**Account-wide singletons are pinned by default, on every machine.** A repo's
Merge Master and Task Manager are one task across the account (see the relay
singleton directory), so every machine's list shows them pinned without the
operator pinning them there. The owning machine stamps the pin on its own
`pipeline_item` row once, when it claims the singleton — top of the pinned
group, shifting the operator's existing pins down rather than renumbering
them. A machine that only *views* the task has no row to stamp, so it derives
the default from the singleton identity the owner publishes (`singletonAgent`,
read back from the `singleton-{agent}` workflow name bound at claim time).

It is a default, not a rule. An explicit unpin always wins and always sticks:
on the owner's machine as the cleared `pinned` column (a reclaim of an existing
singleton never re-stamps it), on a viewing desktop as a `null` entry in the
viewer-local `remoteTaskPins` overlay, and on mobile as an entry in the phone's
own `unpinnedDefaults`. Absence of a pin is not the same as an unpin, which is
why the last two are recorded rather than simply left out.

### Diff viewer

- Main-area tab (Cmd+D), retained with the task's other open views
- Scopes: Branch (all changes since merge-base with the configured base), Working (uncommitted)
- Staged toggle to filter staged-only changes
- Scope remembered per task
- `]` / `[` cycle the Diff scope forward / backward while the Diff tab is active; the platform-mapped modified brackets remain global next / previous tab
- Rendered by `@pierre/diffs` with shadow DOM, syntax highlighting via worker pool

The registry in `apps/desktop/src/composables/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` is the
single source of truth for app-level shortcuts. View-local shortcuts are
listed by their active Diff, file, tree, or graph context in the shortcut help.
Main-area tabs stay mounted while hidden, so only the active view may consume
its local keys; registered app shortcuts continue to work while a terminal has
focus.

### Preferences

| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| Suspend After (minutes) | 5 |
| Kill After (minutes) | 30 |
| IDE Command | code |

## Mobile app

The connection model and data paths are in
[Architecture](architecture.md#mobile-app--appsmobile--packagesstream-client);
this is the user-facing surface.

**Structure.** Three tabs — **Tasks** (repo-scoped, with a repo chip row),
**Activity** (unread, not-locally-dismissed tasks across repos), and **More**
(repo commands) — behind a floating toolbar that also carries Search and
"Add task". Tapping a row opens the full-screen task detail: agent view or
terminal, a composer with quick replies and photo attachment, and file/diff
previews. Account, the Machines list, and the Quick Replies editor live in a
modal account sheet; there is no settings tab.

**Task cards** are tinted by workflow stage from the app-icon palette
(`in progress` orange, `review` purple, `pr` green, `consultation` blue;
custom stages hash onto a fixed sub-palette; blocked is a rose badge on top of
the stage color). A short task id sits beside the truncating title; unusually
long IDs middle-ellipsize in their bounded metadata column so the title remains
legible. Up to three lines of the task's latest output snippet render on the card — live via
the KSP task-summary stream while connected, falling back to the resting
(Firestore) snippet on disconnect.

**Pins and dismissals are phone-local.** Swiping a row left and releasing past
the threshold commits the action (pin/unpin in Tasks, dismiss in Activity);
releasing inside the threshold cancels — there is no revealed-button state.
Pins order to the top of the repo list; a dismissal hides the task from
Activity until newer activity arrives. Neither is published to the desktop,
and a mobile dismiss never marks the task read for the desktop or
supervisors. Account-wide singletons are pinned by default here too, above
the phone's own pins — see "Pinned tasks" above.

**Pairing.** A desktop is added by scanning its QR code (or typing the 6-char
code): the phone finds the desktop via Bonjour on the LAN and claims the
pairing session over HTTP, receiving a device credential that is independent
of the signed-in account (manually paired machines survive sign-out; signing
out does drop the account's machines). After pairing, the app immediately
loads the new machine's work and shows the wait. Machines shows every desktop
merged from the account, manual pairing, and live LAN discovery, grouped by
availability.

**Photo attachments.** The composer can attach one photo (library or camera)
to a task input; images are resized/re-encoded to JPEG within a 3 MiB budget.
The control appears only when the task's own desktop advertises attachment
support (asked once per task and route), and permission denials explain
whether to retry or open Settings. The desktop stores the image outside the
worktree and appends `[Attached image: <path>]` to the injected input.
