# Architecture

Kanna is a set of cooperating processes centered on the desktop app. This page
describes each component, the boundaries between them, and where the code
lives.

```

Connections are client-initiated. The mobile app reaches `kanna-server`
directly over the LAN when it can (discovered, trusted desktops on the same
network) and through the relay when remote — the connection mode switches at
runtime, in every environment. It also talks to Firebase Auth directly to
sign in. The relay never dials the
desktop: `kanna-server` maintains a persistent outbound WebSocket to the relay
(reconnect loop with ping/pong keepalive in `crates/kanna-server/src/relay.rs`),
and the relay bridges remote clients onto that connection. Between the daemon
and `kanna-server`, commands flow server→daemon while events flow
daemon→server — the server issues a `Subscribe` command and then consumes the
daemon's event stream (`crates/kanna-server/src/terminal_watcher.rs`).

Agent-facing control surfaces (`kanna-cli`, `kanna-mcp`) talk to the same
`kanna-server` HTTP API rather than to the daemon or the DB directly.

## Components

### Desktop app — `apps/desktop/`

Tauri v2. The Vue 3 frontend (`src/`) renders the task sidebar, xterm.js
terminals, diff viewer, and modals; state lives in a single Pinia store
(`src/stores/kanna.ts`). The Rust backend (`src-tauri/`) exposes Tauri commands
(`src-tauri/src/commands/` — agent, daemon, git, fs, shell) and hosts the app
core (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`): the daemon event bridge with auto-reconnect, the
reattach coordinator, daemon spawning, and macOS integrations. A browser mock
layer (`tauri-mock.ts` and friends) lets the frontend run in a plain browser
without Tauri.

There is deliberately no prose inventory of components, composables, stores, or
Tauri commands — the tree is the inventory, and a written copy goes stale.
Read `src/components/`, `src/composables/`, `src/stores/kanna.ts`, and
`src-tauri/src/commands/` directly.

### PTY daemon — `crates/daemon/`

A standalone process that owns every agent and shell PTY session, independent
of the app lifecycle, so sessions survive app restarts and upgrades. Raw libc
PTYs, line-delimited JSON over a Unix socket, and `SCM_RIGHTS` fd transfer for
seamless handoff from an old daemon to a new one. While detached, output is
interpreted into a per-session headless terminal that is authoritative for
reattach snapshots. Agent lifecycle hook events (`HookEvent`) flow through the
daemon and are forwarded to subscribers.

The full contract — invariants, startup/handoff sequence, session lifecycle —
is specified in [`crates/daemon/SPEC.md`](../../crates/daemon/SPEC.md). Read it
before touching daemon code.

### Headless worker — `crates/kanna-worker/`

The per-user supervisor that runs Kanna without a GUI. It launches the daemon
and the server as its own direct children, authorizes the server on every
daemon generation, and restarts the server when it dies. It owns startup,
authorization and lifetime — nothing else. Orchestration stays in
`kanna-server`; terminal authority stays in the daemon.

It exists because the daemon's trust roots are its **live direct parent**, and
on Linux the obvious arrangement — daemon and server as two `systemd --user`
units — cannot supply one: the user manager holds capabilities, so the kernel
marks it non-dumpable and `/proc/<pid>/exe` is unreadable even to the same uid.
An ordinary user binary in between is the only shape that keeps both the trust
root and the service manager's lifetime. On macOS the desktop app plays this
role; the worker is portable and runs there too, which is what lets one
exit-gate lane cover both platforms.

Its signals mirror the desktop's semantics deliberately: `SIGHUP`
(`systemctl --user reload`) spawns a replacement daemon and live sessions hand
off to it; `SIGTERM` stops the server and leaves the daemon and its sessions
running, exactly as closing the app does. Its unit sets `KillMode=process` for
the same reason. `kanna-worker stop-daemon` is the explicit full teardown.

Evidence and the platform measurements behind it:
[`docs/2026-09-08-linux-phase1-headless-worker.md`](../2026-09-08-linux-phase1-headless-worker.md).

### Local API server — `crates/kanna-server/`

The desktop-side service boundary for every non-desktop consumer (mobile app,
`kanna-cli`, `kanna-mcp`). Serves a versioned HTTP + WebSocket API on the LAN
(default `127.0.0.1:48120`), including `/v1/stream`, a multiplexed KSP
(Kanna Stream Protocol) WebSocket carrying terminal, agent, and task frames.

`kanna-server` **owns SQLite**: all schema definitions and migrations live in
`crates/kanna-server/src/db/mod.rs`, and server startup completes legacy
file relocation before opening the DB. The desktop frontend's `stores/db.ts` is
only a compatibility facade. It also subscribes to daemon events server-side,
so task completion state and events do not depend on the frontend being open.

Boundary and route surface: [`docs/kanna-server-boundary.md`](../kanna-server-boundary.md).

### Agent control surfaces — `crates/kanna-cli/`, `crates/kanna-mcp/`, `crates/kanna-tool-catalog/`

Agents running inside task worktrees manage tasks through these:

- `kanna-mcp` — MCP server exposing `kanna_*` tools (create/get/list/search
  tasks, send input, complete stages, …) backed by the `kanna-server` API.
- `kanna-cli` — the shell fallback for the same operations
  (`kanna-cli stage-complete`, `kanna-cli task send-input`, `kanna-cli tool call …`).
- `kanna-tool-catalog` — the single declarative source of truth for the tool
  surface, shared by both. Tools are described as HTTP method/path/params
  manifests; `kanna-mcp` hot-reloads override catalogs and emits
  `tools/list_changed`.

Never read or write SQLite directly for orchestration — go through these.

### Agent protocol and SDK — `crates/kanna-agent-protocol/`, `crates/claude-agent-sdk/`

`kanna-agent-protocol` is the Rust source of truth for agent provider
definitions (`providers.rs` generates the `"claude"` / `"copilot"` / `"codex"`
/ `"opencode"` / `"antigravity"` registry) and for KSP frame types, from which
the TypeScript package `packages/agent-protocol` is generated.
`claude-agent-sdk` wraps the Claude CLI for headless (SDK-mode) sessions:
NDJSON streaming over stdin/stdout, permission callbacks, and the bidirectional
control protocol (interrupt, set model/permission mode, `CanUseTool`).

### Mobile app — `apps/mobile/` + `packages/stream-client/`

Expo / React Native iOS app, a first-class client. It has two data paths:

- **Desktop data** comes from `kanna-server` — plain `/v1/…` HTTP over the LAN
  when a trusted desktop is reachable, or `invoke` frames and KSP tunnels
  through the relay when remote. The two are raced per read (cloud read plus
  an optional 1 s LAN read), and every task is routed to its owning desktop
  (`ownerDesktopId`). While the app is foregrounded it keeps **one persistent
  authenticated relay control socket** (bounded-backoff reconnect, paused in
  the background) reused for desktop-presence refreshes and control invokes;
  per-desktop terminal/agent/task-summary streams ride separate KSP tunnels.
- **Cloud resting data** comes from Firebase directly: Auth for sign-in, and
  the Firestore cloud task index (`users/{uid}/desktops/{id}/tasks`) that
  `kanna-server` publishes through the relay. Live task-card snippets stream
  over a desktop-wide KSP `task_summary` subscription and overlay the resting
  Firestore rows; on disconnect the overlay falls back to the resting values.

Machines are merged from three sources — account desktops (Firestore),
manually QR/code-paired desktops (a LAN pairing claim carrying its own device
credential, independent of the account), and live LAN discovery. Task pins and
Activity dismissals are deliberately phone-local (AsyncStorage), never
published to the desktop.

`@kanna/stream-client` is the shared KSP WebSocket client (auth handshake,
per-task attachments with seq-resume, request/response correlation, reconnect)
used by both the mobile app and, increasingly, the desktop frontend. Native
identity (bundle id, display name) is keyed by `KANNA_APP_ENV`; OTA
compatibility is keyed by `runtimeVersion` in
`apps/mobile/src/mobileEnvironments.json` — see [Release](release.md#mobile-ota).
The user-facing surface is described in
[Product Behavior](product-behavior.md#mobile-app).

### Cloud services — `services/`, `apps/web-portal/`

- `services/relay/` — Node 22 / TypeScript WebSocket relay connecting remote
  mobile clients to a user's desktop `kanna-server`
  (`wss://relay.kanna.build` / `wss://relay-staging.kanna.build`). Each
  environment runs **one GCE e2-micro VM** behind Caddy TLS via docker
  compose; `./kd cloud deploy --relay` builds the image with Cloud Build,
  pushes to Artifact Registry, and the VM pulls it — the full runbook is
  [`docs/relay-vm-operations.md`](../relay-vm-operations.md), and the growth
  plan is [`docs/specs/relay-scaling.md`](../specs/relay-scaling.md). What
  moves over it:
  - The desktop side of each bridge is the persistent outbound connection
    described above. Over the control socket the relay forwards client
    invokes (HTTP-over-relay, including `/v1/task-events` long polls under a
    separate long-poll permit budget), mobile push notifications, and cloud
    task snapshot publication.
  - **Tunnels** carry the streaming protocols; exactly two tunnel service
    classes exist — `ksp` (the Kanna Stream Protocol, including raw terminal
    bytes) and `task-transfer` — each with its own backpressure watermarks.
  - It also serves mobile OTA manifests/assets from GCS (`/ota/manifest`,
    `/ota/assets`).
  - Operations surface: a per-connection **byte odometer** (application bytes
    per uid/desktop/message class: `tunnel`, `taskTransfer`, `terminalEvent`,
    `control`), exposed at `GET /stats` and a live `/dashboard`, read via
    `./kd relay stats` with the operator token from Secret Manager
    (`kanna-relay-stats-token`). `permessage-deflate` is negotiated per client
    (the mobile leg; the desktop's tokio-tungstenite client connects plain).
    Abuse bounds: `maxPayload` is 16 MiB, applied by `ws` to the
    **decompressed** frame size (which is what keeps compression safe
    pre-auth), derived as 2× the largest enforced legitimate frame — the
    8 MiB task-input body — and overridable per VM with
    `KANNA_RELAY_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`; pre-auth per-IP admission caps bound
    unauthenticated connections and upgrade rate. Successful
    desktop-credential validations and
    entitlement reads are each cached for 60 s; a new desktop-credential
    connection always re-reads Firestore (so a revoked desktop cannot
    reconnect), while entitlement resolution at authentication may be served
    from the entitlement cache.
  - **Entitlement enforcement** exists behind `KANNA_RELAY_ENTITLEMENT_ENFORCEMENT`,
    off in every environment until the billing flag day: when on, an
    unentitled session still authenticates but is refused tunnels,
    publication, and invokes with code 4402; a Firestore outage fails open.
    LAN is permanently unaffected.
  - A remote dev-server **preview** path over the relay is specified but not
    yet built — see [`docs/specs/remote-dev-preview.md`](../specs/remote-dev-preview.md).
- `apps/web-portal/` — the Vue 3 account portal (sign-in, email verification,
  subscribe via Stripe Checkout, entitlement status), deployed as the
  `account` Firebase Hosting target (`{project}-account` sites, mapped for all
  three projects in `.firebaserc` and guarded by a kd test). It is part of the
  default `./kd cloud deploy` payload.
- `services/firebase-functions/`, `firestore.rules`, `firebase.json` — Firebase
  Auth, Firestore (device pairing/auth records, the cloud task index, billing),
  and functions. Projects: `kanna-build` (production), `kanna-staging`
  (staging), `kanna-local` (emulators). Exactly two functions are deployed —
  the billing backend (`createCheckoutSession`, `stripeWebhook`). The webhook
  is the only writer of the `users/{uid}/billing/stripe` source doc and never
  writes the entitlement doc directly: a shared reducer derives the single
  `users/{uid}/entitlements/cloud_access` record from every source
  (stripe / app_store / comp) in the same transaction
  (`docs/specs/accounts-and-billing.md`). Comp/grandfather grants are seeded
  by `services/firebase-functions/scripts/grant-comp-access.mjs`
  (`docs/comp-access-runbook.md`).

Deploy only via `./kd cloud deploy` (with `--staging` or `--production`),
never the Firebase CLI directly; function deploys additionally require
`--functions`, so reviving them stays a deliberate act.

### Supporting crates and packages

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `crates/runtime-defaults/` | Shared constants: bundle ids, DB name, relay URLs, Firebase project ids, ports |
| `crates/server-process/` | Who is listening on `kanna-server`'s port, and how to stop them — shared by both launchers (the desktop app and `kanna-worker`), because a launcher must attribute a port to a real pid before it authorizes one, and two copies would drift |
| `crates/task-transfer/` | Peer-to-peer desktop protocol (mDNS discovery via `_kanna-xfer._tcp`, crypto, peer registry): task transfer plus peer task snapshots and observing/sending input to peer sessions |
| `crates/tauri-plugin-delta-updater/` | Self-updater plugin (stub) |
| `packages/core/` | Shared TS business logic: workflow types/tags, repo config, custom tasks, GitHub/Slack/Discord clients |
| `packages/db/` | TS mirror of the SQLite schema plus a query layer over the `DbHandle` interface |
| `packages/terminal-recovery/` | Rust terminal snapshot/session-mirror service (staged at runtime via `scripts/stage-terminal-recovery-runtime.sh`) |
| `tools/kd/` | The `kd` development CLI and the `kd-mcp` server (task registry in `src/tasks/registry.ts`) |
| `tools/bazel/`, `BUILD.bazel`, `MODULE.bazel` | Bazel release build graph (see [Release](release.md)) |
| `tests/` | Cross-cutting suites: CLI contract, PTY test util, remote E2E, TUI fidelity |

Direct LAN terminal observation is duplex from task-transfer protocol v4: once
the authenticated observation stream is live, ordered input and resize controls
travel back over that same socket. Protocol v5 adds explicit producer-declared
submission and control semantics. Terminal input fails closed across a v4/v5
rolling upgrade because v4 cannot preserve those fields; current peers retain
read-only observation of protocol-v3 and older peers, but reject terminal input
there for the same reason.

## Core data flow

Task creation and terminal streaming, end to end:

1. User creates a task (⇧⌘N) → the frontend store calls `createDesktopTask`
   against the `kanna-server` HTTP API (`apps/desktop/src/stores/taskItemActions.ts`
   → `services/desktopServerClient`). **`kanna-server` owns creation**
   (`crates/kanna-server/src/task_creator/`): it writes the DB row, creates
   the worktree at `{repo}/.kanna-worktrees/task-{uuid}` on branch
   `task-{id}`, and runs the repo-config `setup` commands.
2. `kanna-server` then asks the daemon to `SpawnAgent` — the daemon forks the
   agent CLI in a PTY and starts the single per-session reader feeding the
   headless terminal.
3. Frontend `AttachSnapshot` hydrates xterm.js from the headless terminal, then
   streams live output; typed input goes back through `send_input` → PTY.
4. The daemon emits terminal-state events; `kanna-server`'s terminal watcher
   persists them as the task's `runtimeState` and derives the
   `activity`/read-state effects (a stopped, unviewed task shows `unread`).
   The user reviews the diff (⌘D) and advances the workflow (⌘S).
5. Stage transitions fork a fresh workspace (new branch + worktree cut from
   the task's **latest committed tip**, resolved across all of the task's
   workspace branches — see `crates/kanna-server/src/task_creator/work_tip.rs`)
   and respawn the session for the next stage's agent; only committed work
   crosses stage boundaries.

Workflow semantics are split across three places: task/workflow/workspace/post
definitions and close behavior are in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) under
"Core concepts"; the stage-advance contract is under its "Common Pitfalls";
and the user-facing task flows, close steps, shortcuts, and the **revision
contracts** — provider-neutral session resume, the default budget of 5
agent-requested rounds (`0` = unlimited), exhausted-agent parking vs. the
human reset, and the prompt-plus-delivered-input terms that later stages review
against — are in
[Product Behavior](product-behavior.md).

### Beyond the desktop: events, inputs, and the cloud path

The contracts below are specified in
[`docs/kanna-server-boundary.md`](../kanna-server-boundary.md); this is the map.

- **Task event feed.** Events are appended by the same DB calls that change
  the state they describe, inside the caller's transaction where there is one
  — the log stays consistent with `pipeline_item`/`stage_run` by construction
  rather than by call sites remembering to publish (not every task-state
  write emits an event; pinning, for example, does not).
  `GET /v1/task-events` is a cursor-based long poll over `task_event.seq`;
  event kinds cover task lifecycle, runs and stage changes, input
  delivery/blocking, awaiting-input, runtime and activity edges, blocked
  state, merge signaling, teardown failures, and transfer finalization
  (`crates/kanna-server/src/db/task_events.rs`). Three of those kinds carry
  the agent-supervision contract and must not be conflated:
  - `task.awaiting_input` is a **positive** signal — the daemon matched
    prompt chrome the agent CLI actually rendered (`Waiting`). It is never
    inferred from a session merely going quiet.
  - `task.runtime_changed` is the **manager** signal: the daemon's runtime
    verdict moving between `busy`, `waiting`, `idle`, and `exited`, with
    `previousRuntimeState`, `runtimeState`, and
    `latestRunFinishedWithoutCompletion` — the parked-awaiting-advance
    signature. Entering `busy` publishes immediately; every non-busy value
    must hold for a fixed 10 s server debounce, so flicker emits nothing.
    It never encodes read/unread state. `task.runtime_settled` is its
    deprecated busy→non-busy alias, appended in the same transaction.
  - `task.activity_changed` is the provider-neutral **settled display**
    transition — the human read/unread dimension, debounced server-side
    (`activity_event_debounce_seconds`, default 20 s): every activity
    direction emits once after the new value has held, for every provider,
    with no waiting-prompt placeholder required; a flicker inside the window
    emits nothing. A person reading a task moves it, so it is a display
    signal, not a supervision one — managers exclude it with
    `excludeEventTypes` and watch `task.runtime_changed`. It does not prove a
    question was asked; `task.awaiting_input` remains the question signal.
    (This server-side debounce is task `6b9fb72a` / PR #1164, which replaced
    the earlier `task.idle_sustained` design — no such event exists.)

  Cross-machine consumption is
  the **`ks1.` aggregated cursor**: when the caller is account-authorized and
  relay routing is up, the local server fans the wait out to sibling desktops
  as relay invokes, stamps every event with `machineId`, keeps one opaque
  native cursor per machine (no fabricated global order), and reports
  unreachable peers as `machineErrors` with `stale: true`. `kanna-mcp` keeps
  its own older `km1.` client-side fan-in for explicit multi-machine task-id
  sets. A task manager consumes the feed by looping `kanna_wait_events` with
  the returned cursor; a repository-scoped wait issued from inside a task
  session excludes the caller's own task (`excludeTaskIds`, applied by the
  shared catalog policy) so a manager is never woken by its own settled
  runtime edge. The mobile app does **not** use
  this feed — its cross-machine view is the Firestore task index plus KSP
  task-summary streams.
- **Task input pipeline.** `POST /v1/tasks/{id}/input` writes into the live PTY
  through the daemon, which types the text and writes its submission boundary
  as one write. A success means *written*, boundary included. A live session
  always takes the message: the daemon does not wait for the terminal to settle
  and does not inspect the composer, so a human's unsent draft is a collision
  the message lands after rather than a reason to hold it (owner decision,
  2026-09-08). Deliveries the daemon confirms are appended to the durable
  `task_input` ledger with source (`operator`/`manager`/`unspecified`), stage,
  and run. Historical rows may use the retired `notify` source.
- **Composer attestation.** The daemon's typed-byte ledger
  (`crates/daemon/SPEC.md`, protected-input and composer-attestation) answers a
  separate question: whether text on a composer line was typed by somebody
  (`typed`), is provably the provider's own chrome (`not-typed`), or cannot be
  proven either way (`unknown` — an inherited session, or one adopted from a
  daemon that handed over no ledger). It governs what may be *read*, never
  whether a message is delivered. Composer text is never session output: task
  detail reports it separately as `composer: { text, attestation }`, the
  task-logs tail labels the composer line, and text whose attestation is not
  `typed` must never be read as an instruction.
- **Completion observation.** `kanna-server` subscribes to daemon
  terminal-state events directly (never through the desktop frontend) and
  records the terminating run/runtime state and durable events. Managers use
  `kanna_wait_events` for fan-out or `kanna_wait_task` for one task; completion
  is not delivered as input to another task.
- **Cloud task publication.** `kanna-server` polls its own task snapshot
  every 500 ms, fingerprints the envelope, and publishes changes through the
  relay to Firestore (`users/{uid}/desktops/{id}/tasks`) under a
  session-generation/sequence fence. Publication is **diff-aware** end to
  end: an unchanged snapshot sends nothing, and the relay reconciles against
  a per-session index so a converged publish costs zero Firestore reads and
  writes. Continuously changing output snippets are kept off this path
  entirely — they stream over KSP `task_summary` frames while Firestore holds
  only the **resting** snippet, refreshed at boundaries: task close, a
  `working` → `idle`/`unread` transition, or a changed `transition_revision`
  (`crates/kanna-server/src/cloud_task_publisher.rs`).

## Source-of-truth boundaries

Worth internalizing — most architectural mistakes violate one of these:

- **SQLite schema/migrations** → `crates/kanna-server/src/db/mod.rs` only.
- **Agent provider registry** → generated from
  `crates/kanna-agent-protocol/src/providers.rs`.
- **Task-tool surface** (MCP + CLI) → `crates/kanna-tool-catalog`.
- **KSP frame types** → Rust in `kanna-agent-protocol`, generated into
  `packages/agent-protocol`.
- **Shared environment constants** → `crates/runtime-defaults`.
- **Built-in agent/workflow definitions** → `.kanna/` files bundled as Tauri
  resources, never TypeScript string constants.
- **Packaged app version** → the root `VERSION` file.
- **Task completion observation** → durable server run/task events and the MCP
  wait surfaces, never another task's PTY or the desktop frontend event bridge.
