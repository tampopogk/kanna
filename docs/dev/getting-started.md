# Getting Started

This page takes you from a fresh clone to a running development instance of the
Kanna desktop app.

## Prerequisites

macOS with the following installed (all verified by `./kd setup --check`, per
`tools/kd/src/runtime/setup.ts`):

- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- `git`
- Node.js and `pnpm` (the repo pins `pnpm@11` via the `packageManager` field)
- `rustc` / `cargo` — the toolchain version is pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`
  and installed automatically by rustup
- Bazel — the release/packaging build graph (see [Release](release.md))
- Zig — required by the build toolchain
- `tmux` — `kd dev up` runs the dev processes in a background tmux session

`sqlite3` is **not** a prerequisite. `kd` reads and seeds development databases
through the `node:sqlite` bundled with Node, so a machine that has never
installed the command line tool — which is every stock Ubuntu image — works
the same as macOS, which ships one.

For agent sessions you also need at least one agent CLI installed and
authenticated (Claude CLI is the default provider; Copilot, Codex, OpenCode,
and Antigravity are also supported).

## Setup

```sh
git clone <repo-url> kanna
cd kanna
./kd setup          # runs the full prerequisite checks, then pnpm install
./kd setup --check  # the same checks without installing anything
./kd doctor         # quick binary check: git, pnpm, tmux, rustc, cargo
```

The `./kd` launcher self-bootstraps on first run (it pnpm-installs and builds
`tools/kd` before executing). `./kd setup` then verifies the Xcode Command
Line Tools, the toolchain commands listed above, and the workspace
`node_modules`, and installs workspace dependencies with `pnpm install`.
`./kd doctor` is a narrower any-time health check of the six binaries listed
in the comment above.

Use `pnpm` for all package management and script execution — never npm.

## Run the app

```sh
./kd dev up
```

Always launch through `kd` — never `pnpm run dev`, `pnpm exec tauri dev`, or
`cargo tauri dev` directly. `kd` resolves the instance context (main checkout
vs. worktree), assigns ports, derives the per-instance database and daemon
directory, writes a local Tauri config, and starts everything in a background
tmux session.

Useful follow-ups:

```sh
./kd dev status     # what's running
./kd dev log        # recent desktop output from the tmux session
./kd dev down       # stop the session
./kd env print      # resolved ports, DB path, daemon dir, transfer root
```

Variants: `./kd dev up --mobile` (desktop + Expo mobile app),
`--emulators` (Firebase emulators), `--seed` (seed data, from a worktree),
`--attach` (attach to the tmux session). See
[Development Workflow](dev-workflow.md) for the full `kd` reference.

### First build takes a while

The first `./kd dev up` in a fresh checkout or worktree compiles ~523 Rust
crates. The daemon builds quickly, but the full Tauri app takes several
minutes. Subsequent builds are incremental. Rust build artifacts go to
`.build/` (not `target/`) — configured in `.cargo/config.toml`.

## Where things live at runtime

| Thing | Location |
|---|---|
| SQLite DB (main checkout) | `~/Library/Application Support/build.kanna/kanna-v2.db` |
| SQLite DB (worktree instance) | same dir, `kanna-wt-{worktree-dir}.db` |
| Daemon data (main checkout) | `~/Library/Application Support/Kanna/` |
| Daemon data (worktree instance) | `{worktree}/.kanna-daemon/` |
| Daemon logs | `kanna-daemon_*.log` in the daemon data dir |
| Frontend (webview) console logs | `/tmp/kanna-webview-*.log` (per instance) |
| Local API (`kanna-server`) | `http://127.0.0.1:48120` (production/main default) |

The desktop app owns the daemon and `kanna-server` lifecycles; you normally
never start those by hand.

## Verify your setup

```sh
./kd test all       # canonical verification: every lane, failing fast
```

It should pass on a clean checkout. The lanes it composes — `pnpm test` (turbo
across the workspace) and `./kd test rust` — can also be run individually. See [Testing](testing.md) for the rest of
the taxonomy (E2E, live agent suites, mobile).

## Developing Kanna in Kanna

The team develops Kanna *with* Kanna: a stable instance (main checkout or the
installed `/Applications/Kanna.app`) manages tasks, and each task runs an agent
in its own worktree under `{repo}/.kanna-worktrees/task-{id}` with its own
ports, DB, daemon, and tmux server. This means you can run the main app and any
number of worktree dev instances simultaneously without conflicts. The
mechanics are covered in [Development Workflow](dev-workflow.md).
