# Testing

## Canonical verification

Every change should pass this before it is considered done:

```sh
./kd test all    # runs every lane below in order, failing fast
```

It composes the individual lanes, which you can still run one at a time:

```sh
pnpm test                  # turbo-run JS/TS suites across the workspace
./kd test rust             # strict Rust clippy, then workspace tests
./kd test desktop-mock-e2e # the desktop mock E2E suite
```

The mock E2E lane drives the real app through WebDriver, so a bare `vitest run`
cannot collect it — `apps/desktop/vitest.config.ts` excludes
`tests/e2e/mock/**`, which means it never ran inside `pnpm test`. Left out of
every gate it rotted silently, so it is now the last lane of `./kd test all`.
It builds the debug app and takes tens of minutes; run it alone with the
command above while iterating, or name individual files:
`pnpm --dir apps/desktop test:e2e mock/task-lifecycle.test.ts mock/stage-advance.test.ts`.

The Rust lane runs `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
after building its prerequisites and before executing test binaries. Warnings
in production code and test targets fail `./kd test all`.

Plus the static checks: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`,
`cargo fmt --all` (Rust formatter is pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`).

## Test taxonomy

| Layer | Where | How to run | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| TS unit tests | `packages/core`, `packages/db`, `apps/desktop/src/composables/*.test.ts`, `tools/kd` | `pnpm test` (or `pnpm test` in the package dir) | — |
| Rust unit/integration | crate `tests/` dirs across `crates/` | `./kd test rust` | — |
| Daemon tests | `crates/daemon/tests/` | `./kd test rust` | spawns real daemon processes |
| CLI contract (offline) | `tests/cli-contract/tests/offline/` | `pnpm test` | — |
| CLI contract (live) | `tests/cli-contract/tests/live/` | `pnpm test:agent-cli-compat` | installed + authenticated agent CLIs; consumes quota. The TUI-driven pins also need `/usr/bin/python3` (it hosts the PTY — see `helpers/pty.ts`). Everything skips, rather than fails, when a CLI or the PTY is unavailable |
| TUI fidelity | `tests/tui-fidelity/` | `pnpm test:tui-fidelity` | live/process-heavy |
| Remote E2E | `tests/remote-e2e/` | `pnpm test:remote-e2e` | see `docs/2026-07-09-remote-e2e-layer-c-d-runbook.md` |
| Desktop E2E (mock) | `apps/desktop/tests/e2e/mock/` | `./kd test desktop-mock-e2e` | macOS debug build |
| Desktop real E2E (unattended) | `apps/desktop/tests/e2e/real/` | `./kd test desktop-e2e` | macOS; OpenCode free model configured by the runner |
| Desktop real E2E (operator) | files listed in `apps/desktop/tests/e2e/realTiers.ts` | `./kd test desktop-e2e-operator` | credentials and/or an explicit human operator; see below |
| Claude-CLI Rust integration | `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tests/` | `cargo test --test agent_cli_integration -- --ignored --nocapture` | `claude` in PATH |
| Mobile Appium E2E | `apps/mobile` | `pnpm --dir apps/mobile run test:e2e:smoke` (+ `:preflight`) | local simulator; device variants are human-run |
| Shell fixture tests | `scripts/*.test.sh` | run directly | — |

### Desktop E2E tiers

E2E uses W3C WebDriver via `tauri-plugin-webdriver` — debug builds only (macOS
WKWebView). The runner starts isolated app instances, databases, daemons,
Firebase emulators, and relay processes as required by each file. It allocates
and claims each port for the lifetime of the run, so sequential and parallel
runners do not share a listener.

The real suite has two exhaustive tiers declared in
`apps/desktop/tests/e2e/realTiers.ts`; a unit test fails if a real test file is
unclassified or appears in both:

| Tier | Command | What it proves | When it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unattended | `./kd test desktop-e2e` | Real desktop UI ↔ server ↔ daemon/PTY, git/worktree, local/LAN/relay, Firebase-emulator, and companion-browser wiring. Live agent cases use the runner's OpenCode free model. | Nightly and pre-release; also before landing changes to these boundaries. It is deliberately **not** part of `./kd test all`. Adding that merge-gate cost is a separate product decision. |
| Operator | `./kd test desktop-e2e-operator` | Deployed-cloud credential smoke files and retained provider-specific Codex/Claude files. | Only when an operator intentionally supplies the required account/credential context. Missing credential/provider context skips the affected file. Never use this as an unattended Claude lane. |

The operator tier currently contains:

- `cloud-prod-smoke` and `cloud-relay-desktop-auth`: deployed-cloud credentials;
- `sdk-lifecycle-codex` and `stage-advance-sdk-codex`: Codex account/quota and provider-specific SDK behavior;
- `local-transfer-claude-transcript` and `themed-claude-session`: retained Claude-specific coverage. The default runner does not drive Claude programmatically; OpenCode continuity and terminal-theme coverage remain in the unattended tier.

Run a single file through the harness, never through bare Vitest:

```sh
pnpm --dir apps/desktop test:e2e real/pty-session.test.ts
```

When debugging against an already-running desktop instead of the harness, keep
the preload's explicit test-database guard enabled:

```sh
KANNA_E2E_TEST_SQL=1 ./kd dev up --db kanna-test.db
```

Mock suites (`tests/e2e/mock/`) cover app-launch, task lifecycle, diff view,
import, keyboard shortcuts, preferences. Real suites cover the process
boundaries listed above. Tests reach Vue internals via
`__vue_app__._instance.setupState`, which only exists in dev builds.

### E2E app instances never take focus

Every desktop E2E lane launches real macOS app instances — one for the whole
mock run, a fresh one (or pair) per real test file, plus the installed bundle in
`scripts/app-update-full-bundle-e2e.sh` — and a real macOS app activates itself
at launch. That took the operator's keyboard focus mid-sentence, repeatedly, for
the length of a run.

The harness therefore sets `KANNA_E2E_NO_ACTIVATE=1` on every instance it
launches. The app reads it in its Tauri setup (`src-tauri/src/macos.rs`) and
adopts `NSApplicationActivationPolicyProhibited`, which tao applies just before
its launch-time `activateIgnoringOtherApps:` — so that call becomes a no-op and
the instance never comes to the front. `Accessory` is not enough: an accessory
app has no Dock icon but is still activatable, so it still steals focus.

Nothing else sets the variable, so `kd dev up` and shipped builds launch
normally. Windows still render and WebDriver still drives them —
`tauri-plugin-webdriver` reaches the WKWebView through `evaluateJavaScript:` and
screenshots it with `takeSnapshotWithConfiguration:`, neither of which needs an
active app. To watch a run in the foreground the old way:

```sh
KANNA_E2E_NO_ACTIVATE=0 pnpm --dir apps/desktop test:e2e mock/app-launch.test.ts
```

An unactivated WKWebView is not composited, so it delivers no
`requestAnimationFrame` callbacks — and xterm paints on one. Nothing a terminal
renders can be observed in the default lane, live or archived. One test depends
on that: `mock/main-tabs.test.ts`, "renders the archived frame of a retired
terminal opened through the tab surface", proves a retired terminal's stored
frame reaches the screen. It probes frame delivery once and branches: with
frames, it asserts the painted `.xterm-rows` text for both the tab
reconciliation opens behind the one on screen and the tab that is active from
mount; without them, it asserts the same frame arrived in the terminal's buffer
and that the tab lifecycle holds, and logs that the paint proof was skipped.
The skip is printed, never silent. To execute the painted assertions:

```sh
KANNA_E2E_NO_ACTIVATE=0 pnpm --dir apps/desktop test:e2e mock/main-tabs.test.ts
```

`./kd test remote-e2e` is unaffected: its two-instance harness runs
`kanna-server`, `kanna-daemon` and the relay as headless binaries and never
launches the desktop app.

### Live suites cost real quota

`pnpm test:agent-cli-compat`, `pnpm test:remote-e2e`, `pnpm test:tui-fidelity`,
and the `--ignored` Rust integration tests drive real agent CLIs. Run them
deliberately, not as part of routine iteration.

## Timing assertions on a shared box

A dev machine routinely runs four to six worktrees' suites and cargo builds at
once; load averages around 20 are normal. Any test whose pass condition is a
short absolute wall-clock deadline will eventually fail there and pass on
rerun, and a suite that has to be rerun is a suite nobody reads.

Rules for anything that touches a clock:

- **Prefer a happens-before to a duration.** Hold a lock or a worker until the
  measurement is taken, then assert the state directly, rather than inferring
  it from elapsed time.
- **Prefer a ratio to an absolute.** "The synchronous call took a quarter of
  the total decode" survives load; "the call took under 100ms" does not.
- **Use a mocked clock where the subject allows one** — `#[tokio::test(start_paused
  = true)]`, `vi.useFakeTimers()`.
- **Otherwise, pick an order-of-magnitude ceiling and say so in a comment.**
  Name the regression it catches and roughly what that regression costs; the
  ceiling belongs between the healthy path and that cost, not next to either.
- **A liveness wait is not a budget.** `recv_timeout`, `tokio::time::timeout`
  around an expected success, and poll helpers guard against something that
  never arrives. Make them generous: the assertion after them is what proves
  the behavior.
- **Never lean on the runner's per-test timeout to assert speed.**
  `vitest.shared.ts` sets the workspace's `testTimeout`/`hookTimeout` well
  above vitest's quiet-machine defaults, and every package inherits it (a
  `tools/kd` test enforces that). Those ceilings exist so a slow machine is not
  a failing machine. Do not add a per-test override *below* the shared ceiling
  — an override written to raise vitest's old 5s default now lowers it.
  `vitest.setup.ts`, loaded through the same shared options, does the same for
  `vi.waitFor`/`vi.waitUntil`, whose 1s default vitest hard-codes with no
  config knob.
- **A genuine performance benchmark belongs in an opt-in lane**, not in the
  canonical gate.

Port collisions get the same treatment: bind port `0` and read back what the OS
assigned, rather than picking a number and hoping.

## The E2E coverage expectation

Any behavior that crosses component or system boundaries (UI flows,
client↔server interactions, daemon/PTY/git/filesystem behavior, persistence and
reconnect, async coordination) must add or update at least one E2E test.

If that isn't feasible yet, the change must land with a dated note in `docs/`
(`YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-e2e-gap.md` or `…-e2e-note.md`) documenting why it isn't
testable end-to-end, what would make it testable, and what narrower tests were
added meanwhile. Browse the existing notes in `docs/` for the expected shape.

## Manual QA gates

Human-run gates and runbooks live in [`docs/testing/`](../testing/) — notably
the mobile production QA gate required before TestFlight external testing or
App Store submission.
