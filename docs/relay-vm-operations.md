# Relay VM Operations

This runbook provisions and deploys the Kanna relay VM for staging or production. Do not run these steps until the target environment and DNS change are approved.

The relay deploy is build-and-pull:

0. `kd` resolves `--ref <branch|tag|sha>` to a commit. Cloud Build uploads the
   *working tree*, not the ref, so kd refuses a dirty worktree and refuses a ref
   that is not the checked-out commit. `--ref` is required for
   `--production`; without it kd resolves and reports the current `HEAD`.
1. `kd` submits the monorepo Docker build to Cloud Build with `services/relay/cloudbuild.yaml`,
   passing the resolved short commit as the `_COMMIT` substitution.
2. Cloud Build pushes the image to Artifact Registry.
3. The VM logs in to Artifact Registry with its attached service account metadata token.
4. `kd` uploads only `services/relay/deploy/docker-compose.yml` and `Caddyfile`.
5. The VM writes `/opt/kanna-relay/.env`, runs `docker compose pull`, then `docker compose up -d`.

Do not build the relay image on the VM and do not upload the source tree to `/opt/kanna-relay`.

## What is this relay running?

`GET /health` is unauthenticated and reports the source commit baked into the
running image:

```bash
curl -s https://relay.kanna.build/health
```

```json
{"status":"ok","commit":"5022d3f9f0aa","connections":0,"tunnelFlow":{"pauseCount":0,"resumeCount":0,"capRejectCount":0,"maxBufferedBytes":0}}
```

`commit` is the short sha `kd` resolved from `--ref` at deploy time, carried into
the image as the `KANNA_RELAY_COMMIT` build arg. It reads `unknown` for an image
built outside `kd cloud deploy` (a manual `gcloud builds submit` without
`_COMMIT`, or a local `docker build`). Nothing else about the build is exposed —
no branch, no build id.

## How much traffic is this account using?

The relay keeps a **byte odometer**: cumulative sent/received counters per
WebSocket connection, attributed to the authenticated Firebase uid and desktop
id and split by message class. It exists to measure real per-user traffic ahead
of subscription pricing (`docs/specs/accounts-and-billing.md`); it enforces
nothing.

Classes:

| class | what it counts |
|---|---|
| `tunnel` | spliced `ksp` tunnel frames — the Kanna Server Protocol, including raw terminal bytes |
| `taskTransfer` | spliced `task-transfer` tunnel frames |
| `terminalEvent` | terminal stream events routed to `observe_session` observers (how the mobile app watches a terminal) |
| `control` | everything else: auth, invokes, responses, task snapshot publication, mobile notifications, acks |

`received` is what the relay read from that connection; `sent` is what it wrote
to it.

### Logs

One JSON line per connection close, plus an hourly rollup per still-open
connection so a long-lived tunnel is visible before it closes:

```bash
sudo docker compose -f /opt/kanna-relay/docker-compose.yml logs relay \
  | grep '\[bytes\]'
```

```json
{"event":"connection_close","connectionId":41,"uid":"Bax9…","desktopId":"a1b2…","role":"server","tunnelService":"ksp","durationMs":734512,"received":{"tunnel":19283746,"taskTransfer":0,"terminalEvent":0,"control":1024},"sent":{…},"receivedTotal":19284770,"sentTotal":8192,"totalBytes":19292962}
```

`event` is `connection_close` or `connection_rollup`; a rollup carries the same
totals-so-far for a connection that is still open. `KANNA_RELAY_BYTE_ROLLUP_INTERVAL_MS`
overrides the hourly cadence (used by the test suite; the deploy does not set
it).

### `GET /stats`

Everything the relay knows about itself since it started, for ops inspection:

```bash
./kd relay stats --staging
```

Unlike `/health`, this route is never public, and it answers **two credentials
with two visibilities**:

| credential | sees |
|---|---|
| `KANNA_RELAY_STATS_TOKEN` (the operator token, below) | everything, including the live connection list and the recent close rollups — which carry uid and desktop id |
| a Firebase ID token | process aggregates only: no uid, no desktop id, no per-connection row |

The Firebase path is unchanged from before the dashboard landed: an
authenticated account still learns nothing about another account. The
per-connection rows are per-user data, so holding a valid ID token is
deliberately *not* enough to read them.

The credential goes in `Authorization: Bearer …` or in a `?token=` query
parameter; both routes answer `Cache-Control: no-store` and
`Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.

The body:

```jsonc
{
  "status": "ok",
  "commit": "5022d3f9f0aa",
  "connections": 2,                  // paired desktop/phone connections in the router
  "bytes": { "startedAt": "…", "uptimeMs": 0, "connections": { "open": 0, "opened": 0, "closed": 0 },
             "received": { "tunnel": 0, "taskTransfer": 0, "terminalEvent": 0, "control": 0, "total": 0 },
             "sent": { … }, "totalBytes": 0 },
  "compression": { "negotiated": 12, "plain": 29 },   // connections that did or did not negotiate deflate
  "tunnelFlow": { "pauseCount": 0, "resumeCount": 0, "capRejectCount": 0, "maxBufferedBytes": 0 },
  "upgrades": { "admitted": 41, "refused": { "total": 3, "byStatus": { "429": 3 } }, "trackedAddresses": 5 },

  // operator token only:
  "liveConnections": [ { "connectionId": 39, "uid": "Bax9…", "desktopId": "a1b2…", "role": "server",
                         "tunnelService": "ksp", "compressed": false, "openedAt": "…", "durationMs": 734512,
                         "received": { … }, "sent": { … }, "totalBytes": 21336866 } ],
  "recentConnections": [ /* the last 25 close-time rollups, newest first, each with a closedAt */ ]
}
```

Counters are in-memory per process: **a relay restart or redeploy resets every
counter and loses the open connections' totals so far.** Read a window from the
logs, not from `/stats`, when a redeploy may have happened inside it.

## Watching the relay live

### `GET /dashboard`

The same data as a live page, so watching the relay does not mean streaming a
`docker logs` console:

```bash
./kd relay stats --staging --open
```

One self-contained HTML page served by the relay process itself — no new
infrastructure, no external asset, no build step — polling `/stats` every four
seconds and rendering the live connection list, the aggregates, tunnel buffer
pressure, upgrade admission, compression negotiation, and the recent closes. It
requires the **operator token specifically**, because it shows uids; a Firebase
ID token gets a 401 here.

`--open` prints a URL with the token in the query string and launches it. That
is a deliberate trade for a single-operator tool: a page cannot set a header on
its own navigation, the responses are `no-store`/`no-referrer`, and the token
grants nothing but this read. **Treat that printed line as a credential** — it
is the one piece of `kd` output that is one.

A relay running without `KANNA_RELAY_STATS_TOKEN` answers `/dashboard` with a
503 saying so, rather than a 401 that sends you hunting for a credential no
value could satisfy.

### `KANNA_RELAY_STATS_TOKEN`

The operator credential for both routes. It lives in Secret Manager as
`kanna-relay-stats-token`, `kd cloud deploy --relay` writes it into
`/opt/kanna-relay/.env`, and `deploy/docker-compose.yml` passes it to the
container. **A deploy against an environment that has no such secret still
succeeds** — it writes no line, prints a note, and the dashboard reports itself
disabled.

Provision it once per environment (`$PROJECT` is `kanna-staging` or
`kanna-build`, `$SA` the relay VM's service account):

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 \
  | gcloud secrets create kanna-relay-stats-token --project "$PROJECT" --data-file=-
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding kanna-relay-stats-token \
  --project "$PROJECT" --member "serviceAccount:$SA" \
  --role roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
```

Apply the IAM grant through the approved GCP change process; `kd` does not
execute IAM changes. Then redeploy the relay so the VM picks the value up.

`kd relay stats` reads the same secret with **your** gcloud credentials, so your
account needs `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` on it too. Set
`KANNA_RELAY_STATS_TOKEN` in your shell to bypass the secret read entirely — the
env var wins over Secret Manager.

To rotate: add a new secret version, redeploy the relay, and the old value stops
working when the container restarts. The relay refuses a token shorter than 16
characters and logs a warning rather than half-enabling the dashboard with a
guessable credential.

Note that these counters measure **application** bytes — the payload the relay
handed to or received from the WebSocket layer — on both sides. WebSocket
compression (below) sits underneath that measurement point, so `/stats` and the
`[bytes]` lines report pre-compression volume and will not move when
compression is working. That is deliberate: per-user metering should not change
because a client did or did not negotiate an extension.

## WebSocket compression

The relay negotiates `permessage-deflate` on every WebSocket. It is opt-in per
client: anything that sends no `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header — the desktop
app's `tokio-tungstenite` client, today — connects uncompressed and is
unaffected. Nothing needs to be configured, and there is no way to turn it off
short of a code change.

The zlib configuration is bounded for the 1 GB e2-micro and documented at
`services/relay/src/webSocketCompression.ts`: roughly **160 KiB per connection
that actually compresses in both directions**, allocated lazily on that
connection's first compressed frame. If the relay starts showing memory
pressure that tracks connection count, that file is where the window and
`memLevel` bounds live; if it shows *CPU* pressure, lower the deflate `level`
there first.

One consequence worth knowing when reading the tunnel flow counters in
`/health`: the tunnel watermarks measure `bufferedAmount`, which counts the
bytes actually held — so once a frame is compressed onto the socket, it counts
compressed. The memory bound is therefore still exact, but highly compressible
traffic now moves far more application data before it reaches a pause mark.

### `KANNA_RELAY_DESKTOP_CREDENTIAL_CACHE_TTL_MS`

The relay caches a successful `desktopCredentials` validation for 60 s and
serves per-message revalidation from that cache, instead of reading Firestore
on every published message. The TTL is the window in which a credential revoked
elsewhere is still honoured **on an already-open socket**; opening a new
connection always re-reads Firestore, so a revoked desktop cannot reconnect.

Set this variable to shorten that window, or to `0` to disable the cache
entirely and restore a Firestore read per revalidation. The deploy does not set
it; the integration suite does.

## Frame size and pre-auth abuse bounds

Two bounds keep the compression above from being a cheap way to exhaust the VM.
Both are documented with their derivation at
`services/relay/src/webSocketLimits.ts`, and the frame-by-frame inventory they
are derived from is in `docs/task-specs/7a38cc18.md`.

**`maxPayload` is 16 MiB.** `ws` applies it to the *decompressed* size, so it is
what stops a few KiB of compressed upload forcing a huge allocation — before the
caller has authenticated, because extension negotiation happens at the HTTP
upgrade. Peak concurrent decompression memory across the whole process is
`concurrencyLimit × maxPayload`, i.e. 10 × 16 MiB = 160 MiB.

**Per-IP admission runs before the upgrade.** One client address may hold 8
*unauthenticated* connections at once and complete 600 upgrades per minute. The
slot is released the moment a socket authenticates, so how many desktops,
phones, and tunnels a household or a carrier-NAT'd range runs is not bounded —
only how many can sit in the pre-auth window at once. Refusals are logged as
`[ws] Refused upgrade from <address>: <reason>` and answered with 429.

The address is read from `X-Forwarded-For`, last hop, and only when the peer is
private — which it always is in production, because Caddy reverse-proxies to
`relay:8080` and nothing else can reach the container. **If a second proxy hop
is ever put in front of Caddy, that index has to move** or every user lands in
one bucket.

### When a legitimate frame is refused

Two frame classes have no producer-side size bound at all — `term_snapshot`
(a 10,000-row terminal scrollback) and `agent_snapshot` (a whole agent journal).
A pathological but legal terminal can exceed any cap, including the 100 MiB ws
default the relay used before. If a real user is being clipped you will see, per
occurrence:

```
[ws] Oversize frame from <address> (authenticated=true, role=server, maxPayload=16777216); closing that connection only.
```

`authenticated=true` is the tell: an attack does not need to authenticate, so an
authenticated oversize frame is almost certainly a real snapshot. Raise
`KANNA_RELAY_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` on the VM and restart the container, then open a
task to bound the producer — the relay is the wrong place to fix an unbounded
snapshot.

### `KANNA_RELAY_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`

Bytes. Overrides the 16 MiB cap above. A value that is not a positive integer is
ignored with a warning rather than disabling the bound. The deploy does not set
it.

### `KANNA_RELAY_MAX_UNAUTHENTICATED_CONNECTIONS_PER_IP` and `KANNA_RELAY_MAX_UPGRADES_PER_IP_PER_MINUTE`

The two per-IP bounds, for the case where a shared NAT trips one of them. Same
parsing rules, and the deploy sets neither.

## Anonymous mobile push

LAN-paired phones register their own FCM token at `POST /push/pairings` with
the desktop-signed pairing certificate; token refresh repeats the same request,
and `DELETE /push/pairings` revokes it. The Admin-only
`anonymousPushPairings` collection stores one binding per hashed desktop key
and hashed device id. Opportunistic GC removes bindings that have neither been
refreshed nor delivered successfully for 180 days.

Signed-out desktops prove the corresponding Ed25519 key through a fresh
WebSocket challenge and receive only the `mobileNotifications` capability.
They are never entered into the tunnel/router maps, and invoke, tunnel, and
snapshot messages are refused before entitlement handling. The default abuse
bounds are 10 devices per desktop key, 20 desktop keys per token, 30 publishes
per desktop/minute and 500/day, 60 publishes per token/minute and 1,000/day,
plus 30 pairing registrations per IP/minute. These publish limits are
in-memory and intentionally reset with the relay process.

The rate defaults can be lowered during an incident or controlled load test
with `KANNA_ANON_PUSH_DESKTOP_PER_MINUTE`,
`KANNA_ANON_PUSH_DESKTOP_PER_DAY`, `KANNA_ANON_PUSH_TOKEN_PER_MINUTE`,
`KANNA_ANON_PUSH_TOKEN_PER_DAY`, and
`KANNA_ANON_PUSH_REGISTRATIONS_PER_IP_MINUTE`. Invalid or non-positive values
fall back to the defaults. The deploy sets none of them.

## Entitlement enforcement

### `KANNA_RELAY_ENTITLEMENT_ENFORCEMENT`

The checked-in `kd` environment registry explicitly selects **off** for both
staging and production. This is deployment intent, not evidence of either live
VM's state. Enabling requires a separate owner-authorized handoff after the
billing/client prerequisites and cohort decision (`docs/specs/accounts-and-billing.md`,
Decisions 5 and 7). Production Stripe is confirmed not set up as of 2026-09-14;
this technical handoff does not establish payment readiness.

When it is turned on, the relay resolves each authenticated session's uid to
`users/{uid}/entitlements/cloud_access` — the single record the billing reducer
in `services/firebase-functions` derives — and enforces it on both session
kinds, phone ID token and desktop credential:

- An unentitled session **still authenticates**. It receives `auth_ok`, holds
  its socket, and carries an `entitlement` block (`active`, `status`,
  `currentPeriodEndsAt`, `graceEndsAt`, and a `reason` when the refusal is not
  something the entitlement record itself explains) so a client can render
  "subscription required" rather than a connection fault. `status` is the
  record's own word, or `none` when the account has no entitlement document, or
  `unknown` when the relay did not read one.
- It is advertised **no** `tunnelServices`, and no `taskSnapshotPublication` or
  `mobileNotifications` capability — the relay advertises only what it will
  serve.
- `tunnel_request`, `task_snapshot_publish` and `mobile_notification_publish`
  are refused with `code: 4402` and `error: "entitlement required"`. A tunnel
  socket that reaches the relay anyway is closed with the same code.
- Nothing is deleted. A published task index simply goes stale and returns on
  renewal.
- An unverified phone token (`email_verified: false`) is unentitled regardless
  of the entitlement document, reported as
  `reason: "unverified_email"`.
- A Firestore failure while reading the entitlement **fails open**: the session
  keeps working and the error is logged. An outage of the billing database must
  not disconnect every paying subscriber.

LAN is unaffected, permanently: it involves no account and no relay.

### Environment-owned deployment handoff

The source of truth is `relayEntitlementEnforcement` on the selected identity in
`tools/kd/src/runtime/environment.ts`: `staging` for `--staging`, `prod` for
`--production`. Only the literal strings `off` and `on` are valid. Omission
resolves to `off` and is labelled `default off` in plan evidence; any other
value aborts before builds or remote work. Each environment owns its choice
independently. A staging enable is never inherited by production.

Every `kd cloud deploy --relay` writes the resolved value into the replacement
VM `.env`; Compose passes it to the relay. Shell
`KANNA_RELAY_ENTITLEMENT_ENFORCEMENT` and manual VM `.env` edits are not deployment
policy and do not override the registry. Redeploys from the same policy retain
it. A different source revision can contain a different policy, so review the
setting on every deployment and rollback. Firebase project selection from
`KANNA_FIREBASE_STAGING_PROJECT` / `KANNA_FIREBASE_PRODUCTION_PROJECT` or
`.firebaserc` must match the relay registry project; a mismatch aborts before
any selected cloud target deploys.

For a later authorized change:

1. Record the owner authorization, target environment/project, intended `off` or
   `on`, and the known-good source and setting for rollback. Change only that
   environment's registry entry and commit it. Keep production's choice explicit
   even after a successful staging rehearsal.
2. From the clean checkout of the chosen source, capture the local plan. For
   example, replace `<approved-sha>` with that checked-out commit:

   ```bash
   ./kd cloud deploy --staging --relay --ref <approved-sha> --dry-run
   ```

   For production, use `--production` and its separately approved source.
   `--dry-run` requires `--relay` as the only target and runs local Git/config
   checks only: no build, credentials lookup, remote inspection or deployment.
   The result records the full source commit, relay project/VM/environment,
   short image commit, `entitlementEnforcement.value`, and its registry `source`.
   Review the matching project (`kanna-staging` or `kanna-build`) and policy.
3. Only under the separate deployment authorization, run the same canonical
   command without `--dry-run`. `kd` emits safe relay plan evidence before remote
   relay commands and includes the same fields in its successful deploy result.
   Keep that result with the authorization and source revision. It reports the
   submitted configuration, not a readback of running enforcement.
4. Attach proof from the separately authorized rehearsal: matching `/health`
   commit plus paid/comp access, denial for an unentitled account when enabled,
   and retained free account/anonymous push and LAN behavior. `/health` alone
   does not prove enforcement. Record redacted test/build identifiers and
   observed outcomes, never tokens, keys or a dump of the VM `.env`.
5. If the authorized stop conditions occur, use `kd` from the recorded compatible
   rollback source **and review its registry setting in a fresh dry-run**. An
   owner-authorized temporary disable uses a committed `off` for that environment
   and the same deployment path. Carry the intended setting into any older
   compatible source; an old source predating this handoff cannot retain it.
   Disabling enforcement is not cancellation/refund authority and does not
   change entitlement records. Do not restore secrets or billing data from a
   deployment snapshot.

Handoff evidence should name: authorization, environment/project, selected
setting and configuration source, full source revision, dry-run result,
deployment result, behavioral proof, and authorized rollback source/setting.
Unperformed deployment or payment checks remain explicitly unobserved.

The relay runtime itself still accepts `on`/`true`/`1` and `off`/`false`/`0`,
and warns then stays off for unrecognized values. Canonical `kd` deployment
uses the stricter `off`/`on` registry contract above. Relay credential ownership,
capability checks and free push behavior are unchanged.

### `KANNA_RELAY_ENTITLEMENT_CACHE_TTL_MS`

The entitlement read is cached for 60 s per account, for the same reason the
credential cache exists: it is consulted on every publication, push and tunnel
request. The TTL is the window in which an entitlement revoked elsewhere is
still honoured on a live session, and it is also the window after which a
freshly subscribed account starts being served without reconnecting. Set it
lower, or to `0` to disable the cache. The deploy does not set it; the
integration suite does.

## Staging

1. Build the provisioning plan:

   ```bash
   ./kd cloud relay-provision --staging
   ```

2. Run the first command from the plan to reserve the static IP in `kanna-staging`.

3. Add a GoDaddy DNS A record:

   ```text
   relay-staging.kanna.build -> <reserved IP>
   ```

4. Wait for DNS to resolve. Caddy cannot obtain a Let's Encrypt certificate until `relay-staging.kanna.build` resolves to the VM IP.

5. Run the remaining provision commands from the plan to create the VM and firewall rule.

6. Grant the VM service account the least environment-scoped permissions from
   the generated plan. In addition to Firestore, image, and OTA access, push
   delivery requires `roles/firebasecloudmessaging.admin`; without it Firebase
   rejects every device with `cloudmessaging.messages.create` denied.

   FCM also requires an APNs authentication key for the matching iOS app. In
   Firebase Console, open the environment project, then Project settings →
   Cloud Messaging and upload the human-owned `.p8` key with its Apple key and
   team IDs. A `messaging/third-party-auth-error` / `Invalid APNs credential.`
   response means this credential is missing, revoked, or invalid. Never copy a
   production-only credential into staging; use a key authorized for the
   environment's registered bundle ID.

   The VM uses Application Default Credentials for Firebase and an access token from the metadata server for Docker login. The attached VM service account must have `roles/artifactregistry.reader` on the environment project or repository. Apply that IAM grant through the approved GCP change process; `kd` does not execute IAM changes.

   The remote Docker login performed by deploy is equivalent to:

   ```bash
   TOKEN=$(curl -fsS -H 'Metadata-Flavor: Google' \
     'http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token' \
     | sed -n 's/.*"access_token":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
   printf '%s' "$TOKEN" \
     | docker login -u oauth2accesstoken --password-stdin https://us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
   ```

7. Deploy the relay from an explicit source ref:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin && git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
   ./kd cloud deploy --staging --relay --ref main
   ```

   For staging this builds and pushes:

   ```text
   us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/kanna-staging/kanna-relay/relay:latest
   ```

   The deploy command writes `/opt/kanna-relay/.env` with:

   ```text
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=kanna-staging
   KANNA_RELAY_DOMAIN=relay-staging.kanna.build
   KANNA_RELAY_IMAGE=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/kanna-staging/kanna-relay/relay:latest
   ```

   Plus `KANNA_RELAY_STATS_TOKEN=…` when the `kanna-relay-stats-token` secret
   exists in the project (see `GET /dashboard` above); the line is simply
   omitted when it does not.

8. Wire staging apps to:

   ```text
   KANNA_CLOUD_ENV=staging
   EXPO_PUBLIC_KANNA_RELAY_URL=wss://relay-staging.kanna.build
   ```

## Production

Production is the existing VM-backed relay:

```text
relay.kanna.build -> 34.133.233.111
project: kanna-build
```

Use the production plan only when intentionally changing production infrastructure:

```bash
./kd cloud relay-provision --production
git fetch origin && git checkout release/0.2 && git pull --ff-only
./kd cloud deploy --production --relay --ref release/0.2
```

`--ref` is required for `--production`. It is the answer to "which source went
out": pick the release branch or tag production is meant to run, check it out,
and pass it. After the deploy, confirm what is running with
`curl -s https://relay.kanna.build/health` — its `commit` is the short sha of
that ref.

Production deploy builds and pushes:

```text
us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/kanna-build/kanna-relay/relay:latest
```
