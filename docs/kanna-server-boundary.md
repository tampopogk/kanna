# Kanna Server Boundary

`kanna-server` is the desktop-side service boundary for non-desktop consumers.
Mobile clients and future CLI tools should talk to `kanna-server`, not directly to the daemon protocol, Tauri commands, or desktop UI state.

The desktop frontend itself is planned to become a `kanna-server` client as well; see [2026-07-05-desktop-server-migration-plan.md](2026-07-05-desktop-server-migration-plan.md) for the phased migration off direct SQLite access.

## Responsibility Split

- `kanna-server`: LAN HTTP and WebSocket transport, route validation, task listing and search, task lifecycle actions, pairing state
- daemon: PTY and session ownership, terminal input and output, agent process lifecycle
- SQLite DB: repo and task persistence, task metadata, query backing for server resources

## Database opening authority

`kanna-server` validates database access at configuration load, before legacy
relocation touches either file, and immediately before every `Db::open` or
`Db::open_migrated`. Test fixture deletion is guarded too. Task-transfer's
independent companion SQLite opener uses the same runtime-defaults check.
Path resolution, including canonical/legacy preference, does not grant access.

Close-time worktree cleanup is a server-owned command appended after repository
teardown. The teardown retains task isolation. Only the cleanup command restores
`KANNA_TASK_ID` / `KANNA_WORKTREE` to the parent server's values and forwards its
explicit desktop authorization, after checking database access in that parent.
Other isolation signals remain intact, and the cleanup opener checks again.

The real desktop database requires explicit `KANNA_DESKTOP_DB_ACCESS=desktop`,
supplied by the desktop when it launches the server. "Real" covers the shipped
app, the staging desktop — an owner's daily driver, not a scratch instance —
and the legacy identifier; the guarded set is derived from those identifier
constants, so renaming one moves its protection with it. Isolated/test/worktree
processes cannot override the veto with that authorization. `kd` supplies
`KANNA_DB_ISOLATED=1`; macOS's ignored `XDG_DATA_HOME` also vetoes production
access. The guard protects the OS account's production paths independently of
caller-controlled HOME, including aliases and not-yet-created databases.
No schema, migration, filename or storage location changes. See
[database access protection](dev/dev-workflow.md#database-access-protection)
for the complete caller contract and rejected alternatives.

## KSP State Invalidation

`StateChanged` remains a correctness invalidation, but task activity no longer
requires the desktop to fetch and replace the complete `/v1/snapshot`. A
non-structural change to one existing task is published as:

```json
{
  "type": "state_changed",
  "scope": "tasks",
  "task_state": {
    "version": 1,
    "task_id": "…",
    "activity": "working",
    "activity_revision": 12,
    "activity_changed_at": "…",
    "unread_at": null,
    "runtime_state": "busy",
    "read_state": "read",
    "last_output_preview": "…"
  }
}
```

Version 1 is a complete summary of the fields changed by daemon runtime-status
observation and operator read-state changes. It deliberately excludes stage,
pinning, closure, blockers, task membership, and every other field that can
change sidebar ordering or structure. The desktop applies the newest summary
for a known task directly to the existing reactive task object. An unsupported
version, malformed state, missing/ambiguous task, scope-only frame, any
structural task change, and every `repos`, `blockers`, or `settings` change
falls back to the authoritative full snapshot. A reconnect also fetches the
full snapshot because this broadcast has no replay cursor. If a connection's
broadcast subscriber lags, the server forwards a coarse `tasks` frame so any
dropped scoped updates are likewise recovered from the authoritative snapshot.

Compatibility is additive and self-versioned rather than handshake-gated. An
older server omits `task_state`, so a newer desktop follows its existing full
reload path. Older desktop and mobile builds deserialize the known
`state_changed` frame and ignore its unknown optional field; mobile does not
register a state-change listener and continues to consume its task-summary
stream unchanged. A future payload version remains safe because the enclosing
scope still tells an older consumer exactly what to invalidate.

## Terminal Input Boundaries

`POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/input` carries one logical message, not raw terminal
bytes. The daemon writes it immediately: the text, framed as a paste when the
terminal supports it, followed by its submission boundary, as one write. It
does not inspect the composer first, and there is no condition under which it
retains, defers, or refuses the message.

**A live session always takes the message.** Until 2026-09-08 the daemon parked
a delivery behind a human's unsent draft, and withheld its Enter from a
terminal that would not stop repainting; ten seconds later the same session
began refusing every later message until somebody typed into that terminal. It
reproduced three times in one day on 0.3.0-staging.12 — including an owner
answering a consultation from their phone, whose answer never arrived and whose
machine had no way to clear it. The owner's decision is recorded verbatim: *"The
input protection is killing me. I'd rather have collisions."* A message that
occasionally lands after somebody's half-typed line is far cheaper than one that
silently never arrives, so the collision is the accepted outcome and the hold is
gone. Nothing is queued, nothing is parked, and no session refuses input because
of what is on its composer.

**A `204` means written, boundary included.** The message and its Enter are one
PTY write, so the acknowledgement means what a caller assumes it means. The
remaining failures are about the *session*, not the composer:
`no_live_agent_session` when there is no live PTY session or it was replaced
before acceptance, and `503 delivery_uncertain` when the round trip to the
daemon was lost after the bytes may already have reached the PTY — which must
not be retried blindly, and is deliberately not recorded as delivered.

**What survives is composer attestation.** The typed-byte ledger that used to
decide whether to hold a message still runs, because it answers a different
question the codebase depends on: whether text on a `❯` line was typed by
somebody or is the provider's own chrome. Nothing may be read as an instruction
unless it is attested `typed`.

- **A keystroke that cannot type declares no draft.** The desktop declares
  every non-Enter keydown a draft, so opening a task's terminal and pressing an
  arrow, an Escape or a PageUp — or clicking, or scrolling — used to arm the
  ledger and make an empty composer read as a human's unsent line (owner
  report, 2026-09-05). The daemon classifies the bytes of each declared draft
  write and only counts the ones that can put text at a composer: navigation,
  scrolling, deletion, mouse and focus reports, a bare Escape and the abandon
  keys create nothing. Cursor up and down are the exception — they recall a
  previous line *into* the composer, so they count like typing. The full
  classification and why Escape/Ctrl-C/Ctrl-U are inert rather than clearing is
  in `crates/daemon/SPEC.md`.
- **A composer painted grey is not a draft.** Claude Code paints the last
  submitted line back as a faint tab-to-accept ghost, so a session whose ledger
  armed once never rendered a textually empty composer again and reported
  `typed` for the rest of its life — reported by the owner on 2026-09-07, who
  could see the text was grey while typed text is not. The daemon reads the
  composer row's styling and cursor as well as its text, and treats the line as
  the provider's own suggestion when *both* every cell after the prompt is
  faint and the cursor sits at the start of the composer rather than after the
  text. Either signal alone is not enough. The ledger stays the primary
  evidence: a frame may only ever clear it, never arm it.
- **A terminal reply is not a keystroke.** An emulator answers the
  application's own questions — colour reports, device attributes, XTVERSION —
  up the same PTY input path a human types on, and the plain terminal-input
  frame declares every byte it carries a draft unless the client marks it
  control. Those replies' payloads used to be counted as typed characters,
  arming the ledger on a terminal nobody had touched. They are classified and
  excluded.

When the terminal application has enabled bracketed-paste mode, the daemon
frames the text as one paste before the trailing Enter — for a message with an
embedded CR or LF, and for any message of at least 256 bytes. The PTY is
otherwise only a byte stream, and the daemon's writes are not the CLI's reads: a
PTY master takes about a kilobyte per write, so a longer message reaches the CLI
as several separate input events, and an interactive agent TUI consumes them as
several editor actions and submits only a trailing fragment. Measured on
2026-09-05 against Claude Code 2.1.261: a 1,191-byte single-line message was
written as 1022 + 169 bytes, and only the 169-byte tail was submitted.
Unadvertised mode and input short enough to arrive in one write remain unframed,
preserving literal-text and provider slash-command semantics. The paste markers
travel in-band with the bytes, so however the kernel queue divides them the
closing marker still ends the editor operation and the CR after it is a
submission rather than pasted text.

The writer holds a fixed short pause after one delivered message's submission
boundary before the next queued message may own the composer: a CLI needs a
processing turn after Enter, and two deliveries written back to back without one
arrive merged. It is write pacing, not a protection — it always elapses, it
never inspects the terminal, and it cannot withhold a message.

Raw terminal producers classify each frame as draft, submission, or control.
Desktop keyboard events declare unmodified Enter; mobile LAN and relay clients
forward the same boundary bit, while mobile mouse/scroll reports are controls
that neither create nor clear draft state. KSP peers must mutually advertise
`term_input_boundary`; a mixed-version connection rejects all terminal input
rather than accept bytes whose boundary meaning may be lost. CR/LF content is
opaque and never used to infer submission, including inside multiline paste.
Every accepted delivery is also recorded durably against the task — see
[Delivered Task Inputs](#delivered-task-inputs) — because terminal bytes are
not a record any later stage can read.

### Raw terminal keys

`POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/raw-input` (`kanna_send_task_raw_input`,
`kanna-cli task send-raw-input`) writes discrete keys or explicit bytes into a
task's live PTY. It exists because the logical-message route structurally
cannot: that route sends a sentence and the daemon appends its own Enter, so it
can answer a question and never move a selection. On 2026-09-05 an imported
task sat at Claude's workspace-trust selection with no supported way to press
Down; the only route was reading the daemon's session snapshot by hand, opening
its Unix socket directly, and sending `InputIfSession` carrying `[27, 91, 66]`
and then `[13]`.

**One vocabulary, one encoder.** Named keys come from
`kanna_runtime_defaults::terminal_keys`, which the MCP schema advertises as a
closed enum and the server uses to produce bytes; a contract test holds the two
in step. These are the normal-mode `xterm` sequences — cursor keys as CSI
(`ESC [ A`), `home`/`end` as `CSI H`/`CSI F`, `backspace` as DEL — and the doc
comment there says which applications that is *not* right for, rather than
claiming universality. Function keys are absent because F1–F4 have two
encodings in common use. Anything the vocabulary cannot spell unambiguously
goes through `bytes`, hex or base64, decoded server-side so no shell is ever
asked to produce an escape character.

**Enter is a declaration.** Raw writes carry the daemon's
draft/submission/control class, and only the named `enter` key declares a
submission. A carriage return inside `bytes` is refused rather than written:
submission is never inferred from bytes in a stream, so an undeclared CR would
be counted as composer content while the CLI that received it had already
submitted the line — leaving the daemon's composer attestation describing a
prompt that no longer holds what it says. Everything else is declared a draft,
and the daemon's existing content classification decides whether it can latch
one, so navigation and control keys arm nothing. Raw input is deliberately not
a way to clear attestation: there is no caller-chosen class.

**Fenced, ordered, and honest about what it wrote.** Discovery and delivery both
hold the task's lifecycle lease, and every write is fenced to the PTY process ID
that discovery observed, so a stage transition or rerun in between is refused
rather than typed into the replacement. Writes go out one at a time and the
daemon acknowledges each only after every byte reached the PTY, so order holds
within a call and across consecutive acknowledged calls. `200` with
`status: "written"` means all of them landed. A first write refused for a
changed incarnation is a `409` `no_live_agent_session` — nothing was written. A
burst that stops *after* its first write is `503` `delivery_uncertain`, because
those bytes are already in somebody's terminal: the response's `writes` array
names each key `written`, `uncertain`, or `not_written`, and it carries
`retryable: false` like every failure below except one. A daemon predating the
contract answers `503`
`raw_input_unsupported`, which is knowable rather than guessed because the
capability is negotiated by a command that touches no session — see
`crates/daemon/SPEC.md`. A daemon mid-handoff answers `503`
`daemon_handing_off`; it is the one failure carrying `retryable: true`, because
nothing was written and a successor is coming, and repeating the call
re-negotiates and re-observes the pid against that successor rather than
replaying a write into a daemon that no longer owns the terminal. There is no
unfenced fallback at any point. Protected sessions still refuse: `403`
`session_operator_input_only`.

**Keys are not speech.** No `task_input` row is written. That table is the
durable instruction history a later stage reads as owner or manager directives,
and an arrow key answering a menu is an action, not a sentence somebody meant;
recording one there would let a reviewer read terminal control bytes as an
owner's words, and would equally let a menu answered by hand read as an
instruction that was never given. The action is announced on the event feed as
`task.raw_input_delivered` — the declared source, the fenced session pid, the
call's verdict, and every write's key, exact bytes as hex, class, and outcome —
including for uncertain outcomes, because an audit trail that keeps only the
clean cases is wrong about the case somebody will need to reconstruct.

Raw keys enable interactive menus. They are not an approval mechanism: nothing
here decides whether a permission or trust prompt *should* be accepted.

### Image attachments

`POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/input` accepts one optional `attachment`:
`{ fileName?, mediaType, dataBase64 }`, where `mediaType` is one of
`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/heic`. Photos only — no video
and no arbitrary file types.

The agent CLIs are terminal programs, so nothing about the daemon contract
changes: the server writes the decoded bytes to a file and delivers the
caller's text **plus a reference to that file's absolute path** as one ordinary
logical message —
`<text> [Attached image: <path>]`, or the bracket alone when the caller sent no
text. The reference is joined with a space and never a newline, because the
daemon writes a logical message and then a carriage return: an inserted newline
would split one submission into two and put the words in front of the agent
before the picture.

- **Encoding is base64-in-JSON on both mobile transports.** The relay carries a
  desktop invocation as a JSON message and the LAN client posts the same JSON
  to the same route, so one encoding means one handler, one durable record, and
  one thing to test. Multipart would exist on one path only and would buy a
  third of a payload that is capped at a few megabytes anyway.
- **Budget.** 3 MiB decoded per attachment (`MAX_TASK_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BYTES`);
  the route raises axum's body limit to 8 MiB to leave room for base64 plus the
  message. Mobile resizes to a 1568px longest edge and re-encodes as JPEG
  before uploading, which lands ordinary photos far below the cap; the server
  cap is the backstop, not the working limit. Over-budget returns 413
  `attachment_too_large`, an unsupported type 415, and a corrupt payload 400.
- **Storage and lifetime.** Files live beside the database, under
  `<db-dir>/<db-stem>-task-attachments/<task_id>/`, **not** in the task's
  worktree: closing a task snapshots its dirty worktree into a WIP commit, so a
  photo dropped there would be committed onto the branch and appear in every
  diff. They are removed when the task closes, alongside the task's other
  per-task on-disk artifacts. A stored file whose submission then failed is
  deleted again; a file whose delivery was *uncertain* is kept, because the
  agent may already have been told the path.
- **Durable record.** No separate attachment column: the `task_input` row holds
  the exact delivered text, which names the path. The record's contract is what
  entered the session, and a second representation could only disagree with it.
- **PTY sessions only.** A live daemon PTY session is required as it is for any
  other input; SDK-mode tasks answer over the agent stream, which carries text
  alone, and the mobile composer hides the attach control for them.
- **Clients must check `/v1/status` first.** `taskInputAttachmentVersion`
  (currently `1`) advertises this contract, and its **absence is the signal
  that the desktop predates it** — the same convention as `kspStreamVersion`.
  A desktop without the marker deserializes an `attachment` field, ignores it,
  delivers the text alone and still answers `204`, which is indistinguishable
  from success, so a phone that skipped the check would clear its composer
  while the agent answered about a picture it never received. That mismatch is
  the ordinary state on release day: phone and desktop are separate binaries
  on separate cadences. Mobile hides the attach control when the marker is
  absent, and it asks **the desktop that owns the task**, routed the same way
  the input itself is routed — a phone sees tasks owned by several machines at
  different versions, and on the relay path its own connection status
  describes the cloud rather than any desktop.

Desktop-to-desktop LAN input has the same fail-closed rule at task-transfer
protocol v5. A v4 peer may still be discovered and use unrelated compatible
features, but a current sender refuses all terminal input to it and a current
owner refuses its duplex observation/input before contacting the daemon.

## Bounded Terminal Windows

A terminal attach used to hand the client the whole serialized terminal: the
visible screen **plus** up to 10,000 rows of scrollback, re-shipped on every
reconnect. On a phone that is the wrong unit of transfer — the frame inventory
in `docs/task-specs/7a38cc18.md` measured 1.71 MiB base64 for a plain 10,000-row
scrollback and 114.8 MiB for a truecolor one, and a flaky link paid for it again
every time it dropped.

A client that advertises `term_scrollback_window` in its `auth` frame gets three
things instead; a client that does not is served exactly as before, including
its own daemon connection per attachment.

- **`term_snapshot` is a bounded window** — the visible screen plus a bounded
  slice of recent scrollback, capped by both a line count and a byte ceiling
  (`crates/kanna-server/src/terminal_window.rs`). The frame names the retained
  remainder: `history_id`, `scrollback_lines`, and where the live byte stream
  continues (`stream_id`, `stream_offset`).
- **Older scrollback is pulled on demand.** `term_scrollback_request
  { request_id, history_id, before_line, max_lines }` is answered with
  `term_scrollback_chunk { start_line, end_line, data_b64, remaining_lines }`,
  bounded per request by both lines and bytes and served newest-first. A request
  naming a `history_id` the server has replaced is answered with the current one
  and an empty chunk, so the client re-anchors rather than splicing stale rows
  above its buffer.
- **A reconnect replays the delta.** The client tracks its own position by
  adding each `term_output` frame's decoded length to the snapshot's
  `stream_offset` — nothing per-frame travels on the wire — and presents
  `term_resume { stream_id, offset }` on re-attach. Inside the server's replay
  window it receives `term_resumed` and then only the bytes it missed, keeping
  the buffer it already rendered. Outside it, a *bounded* fresh snapshot. Never
  the full history unconditionally. Resume offsets are accepted only at exact
  `term_output` frame boundaries recorded by the ring; an offset inside a frame
  falls back to a fresh snapshot rather than beginning with an ANSI or UTF-8
  continuation byte.

Mobile additionally reconciles transport receipt with emulator receipt after
an app-background grace interval. iOS may suspend WKWebView while native code
continues receiving bytes, so foregrounding resets and rehydrates xterm once
from the contiguous retained buffer. If client compaction has created a gap
between its snapshot and live tail, it discards the resume cursor and requests
a bounded fresh snapshot instead of replaying that invalid local buffer.

Capability clients attach through a session-scoped **terminal tap**: one daemon
connection per session shared by its subscribers, recording live output into a
bounded ring and outliving the last subscriber by a grace window. That grace is
what makes a dropped link cost O(delta); an offset only means anything inside
the `stream_id` generation that produced it, so a daemon reconnect voids it and
the client falls back to a bounded snapshot.

## Terminal Geometry Ownership

Terminal geometry is daemon runtime state, not task or database state. New KSP
clients negotiate `terminal_geometry`, then register each visible terminal on
the authenticated control path with `term_viewer_register` before input or
resize. The role is explicit: the owning desktop may declare `local`; paired,
LAN, relay, observer, and shared-tap clients are `remote` and cannot claim
that role. An undeclared peer is legacy and is never implicitly local.

The daemon elects one controller per PTY. It retains the current eligible local
controller, otherwise chooses a deterministic local candidate, then does the
same for remote candidates. A local arrival preempts an automatically selected
remote controller. Remote/mobile viewers therefore render the authoritative
desktop-sized grid and use their existing pan/scroll presentation; fitting a
remote viewport never resizes the owner. A sole phone can still become the
automatic controller. `term_viewer_takeover` explicitly grants any authorized
viewer control until `term_viewer_release` or disconnect; focus and input do
not reclaim it. A transient transport loss may relinquish takeover, without a
heartbeat or timeout loop.

Only the elected viewer's measured proposal changes the PTY and headless
terminal. Registration and election are serialized with resize and snapshot
cutover. Repeated proposals for the applied size are no-ops; no-viewer state
retains the last applied size. Geometry changes use an ordered snapshot and a
new stream generation rather than byte-offset replay, while resume within
unchanged geometry remains incremental. Snapshot application never echoes a
resize request. Geometry does not clear draft bytes or alter composer
attestation.

Mixed versions are deliberately conservative. New clients against an old owner
suppress automatic remote sizing and report that takeover is unavailable. On a
new owner, legacy resize remains a compatibility minimum only for all-legacy
sessions and cannot shrink a declared controller. New event fields are sent
only after capability negotiation; upgrading the server cannot make an old
renderer a faithful follower. In particular, old mobile/new owner, new
mobile/old owner, new server/old daemon, and rollback combinations must be
treated as unsupported for the synchronized-grid guarantee.

The server separately probes terminal-geometry protocol version 1 on the
daemon control socket. An old daemon closes that probe, so the server falls
back to legacy commands for local compatibility and never sends an automatic
remote resize. A new daemon is probed again after its PID changes. This
prevents a new server from mistaking a successfully written but unsupported
viewer command for an authority grant.

## The Browser/Local-Client Boundary

A loopback address is not authority. `kanna-server` listens on a port any web
page the user opens can reach, so "the peer is `127.0.0.1`" describes the
desktop app, the CLI, an MCP server, a sidecar — and equally a page served by
`http://attacker.example`, by a task's own dev server, or by the task preview
proxy. The router used to grant privileged access on that address alone, under
`CorsLayer::permissive()`, and to promote a browser's WebSocket upgrade of
`/v1/stream` / `/v2/stream` to empty in-band auth, which no CORS rule constrains
at all.

`require_local_client_authority` (`http_api/lan_trust.rs`) classifies every
request on the real listener instead:

- **Tunneled** dispatches (relay, KSP) synthesize their own requests and carry
  their own authenticated marker. They never pass through this middleware.
- **Browser-originated** — the request carries an `Origin` or any `Sec-Fetch-*`
  header. Both are forbidden header names: a browser sets them itself and page
  script can neither suppress nor forge them. Such a request must present this
  desktop's **local control credential** (`Authorization: Bearer <token>` or
  `X-Kanna-Local-Token`), or a verified paired device secret. Otherwise it is
  refused with 403, on every route, before any handler runs.
- **Local process** — no `Origin`, no `Sec-Fetch-*`. Keeps the loopback
  authority it has always had. A process running as the user already holds it:
  it can read the credential file, the database and every worktree, so
  requiring a token from the CLI, the MCP server, the sidecars and every
  running agent would be a migration, not a boundary.
- **Loopback `Host` validation.** DNS rebinding is the one browser attack that
  leaves no `Origin` to inspect: a page at `http://attacker.example` re-resolves
  its own name to `127.0.0.1`, so its fetches are *same-origin* and carry
  neither `Origin` nor a cross-site `Sec-Fetch-Site`. What it cannot rewrite is
  the `Host` it must send. A loopback caller must therefore address this server
  by an IP literal or `localhost`; a DNS name is refused.
- **A CORS preflight** carries no credential and grants none, so it passes
  through to the CORS layer. The request it precedes is classified like any
  other.

The **local control credential** is the 32-byte hex token in
`task-events.token`, beside the pairing store, mode `0600`. It is the same file
the account-wide task-event feed already used; it is now the general local
control credential. Task agents receive its path as
`KANNA_TASK_EVENTS_TOKEN_PATH`.

**CORS headers are not authorization.** `CorsLayer::permissive()` is replaced
by an explicit mirrored-origin layer, but it carries no security weight and
never did: it tells a compliant browser what it may read, and says nothing to a
WebSocket upgrade, a `no-cors` request, or a rebound same-origin one. The origin
is mirrored rather than allowlisted because the desktop webview's own origin is
a moving target (`tauri://localhost` packaged, the Vite origin under `kd dev
up`) and an allowlist there can only ever break the app; authority comes from
the credential, and a mirrored origin grants nothing a rejected request could
use.

The layer stays *inside* the authorization middlewares, where it already was.
`tower_http` short-circuits every `OPTIONS` request as a preflight, so a CORS
layer mounted outside them would answer `OPTIONS` on every route with no
authorization at all — and deny-by-default for every method, preflight
included, is the contract
`every_registered_http_route_denies_unpaired_lan_by_default` pins. The cost is
that a refusal carries no CORS headers, so the webview sees a network error
rather than the 403 text; the server logs the reason at `warn`, and the client
logs a credential it could not read.

### The KSP upgrades

A browser cannot attach a header to a WebSocket handshake, so `/v1/stream` and
`/v2/stream` are admitted past the header check and authenticate in band. A
browser-originated loopback upgrade gets `AuthMode::RequireLocalControlToken`:
its first `auth` frame must carry the local control credential. Non-browser
loopback upgrades keep `AuthMode::AllowEmpty`; non-loopback upgrades keep the
paired-device rules unchanged.

### Who is affected

Nothing that was working stops working:

| Client | Shape | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `kanna-cli`, `kanna-mcp`, agents | no `Origin`/`Sec-Fetch-*`, `Host` is an address | unchanged |
| `task-transfer` and other sidecars | same | unchanged |
| Paired mobile over LAN | React Native `fetch`, no browser headers, device secret | unchanged |
| Authenticated relay dispatch | tunneled | unchanged |
| Desktop webview (packaged and `kd dev up`) | a browser | now sends the credential on every `fetch` and in its KSP `auth` frame |
| A page the user opened, a task's dev server, the preview proxy | a browser without the credential | refused |

The desktop gets the credential from the Tauri command `local_control_credential`,
which reads the server's own credential file; `apps/desktop/src/services/localControlCredential.ts`
caches it for `desktopServerClient`, `desktopTaskActions`, the DEV-E2E SQL route
and the shared stream client.

### Residual limitations

- A browser predating the `Sec-Fetch-*` set (Safari before 16.4) issuing a
  *no-cors* cross-origin GET sends neither `Origin` nor fetch metadata, so it is
  indistinguishable from a local process. The same-origin policy still makes
  that response unreadable to the page, and every state-changing route is
  non-GET, which a browser always accompanies with `Origin`. Rebinding, the way
  such a page would make itself same-origin and readable, is refused by the
  `Host` check regardless of browser vintage.
- A caller may omit `Host` entirely — hyper serves such a request rather than
  refusing it — but a browser cannot, so that only leaves a local process in the
  class it was already in.
- A process already running as the user can read the credential file. This is a
  boundary against browsers, not against local process authority, which Kanna
  does not have and cannot obtain.
- The task preview proxy (`http_api/preview.rs`) is a separate listener with its
  own enter-secret and cookie boundary; it is not covered here.

Boundary behaviour is pinned by `crates/kanna-server/tests/local_client_boundary_http.rs`,
which drives a launched `kanna-server` process over a real socket — hostile
`Origin`, rebinding `Host`, missing and invalid credentials, allowed callers,
preflight, and a genuine WebSocket handshake.

## v1 LAN Surface

HTTP authorization is enforced by default at the router, for every method
(including GET/HEAD and OPTIONS). Direct loopback clients retain local access
only as *local process* clients — a browser reaching the same address is
classified and refused separately, see
[The Browser/Local-Client Boundary](#the-browserlocal-client-boundary);
LAN callers must present `X-Kanna-Device-Id` and `X-Kanna-Device-Secret` verified
against the pairing store. Authenticated relay invokes retain their explicit
internal authority; an unauthenticated tunnel cannot inherit its synthesized
loopback peer. Existing desktop-only and file-specific restrictions still apply.
Unpaired HTTP requests receive status 401 and the existing plain-text body
`privileged control requires desktop loopback, a paired LAN device, or an authenticated relay`,
without handler execution or requested values.

The only public HTTP operations are GET/HEAD `/v1/status` (discovery/health)
and POST `/v1/pairing/sessions/claim` (requires the desktop-issued pairing code).
Starting a pairing session and removing trust remain desktop-only. WebSocket
GET upgrades at `/v1/stream` and `/v2/stream` are authentication bootstrap:
both require proof of pairing for non-loopback peers before any task data.
The first KSP Auth frame verifies the device credential. Legacy v1 readers
already verified through upgrade headers or the stream cookie retain their
existing read-only empty-Auth behavior; unpaired empty-auth LAN reads are no
longer admitted. Loopback empty-auth streams remain supported. KSP state-change
broadcasts start only after successful Auth; an unauthenticated upgrade receives
no task-state notifications. Existing paired clients use the same credential and refusal formats,
so no protocol version changes. The complete route classification is recorded
in `docs/task-specs/c9f5721b.md` and enforced by the router authorization tests.

  accepts optional `source: "operator" | "manager"`. The server records this
  caller declaration without authentication; omission means `unspecified`.
  Engine policy transitions use `auto`. The trigger is stored on the spawned
  main `stage_run`, carried through any pending post run, emitted on
  `stage.changed`, and returned as `latestRun.trigger`.
  It also accepts an optional provider override for the stage the advance
  *enters* — `nextStageAgentProvider`, with `nextStageModel` and
  `nextStageEffort` — which fills the explicit-override slot of the provider
  precedence chain and so outranks that stage's own `agent_provider`
  selectors, the repo's `agentProviders`, agent frontmatter, and the default.
  It is a per-advance override: it changes no workflow definition, no pin, and
  no default, and the stage after it resolves normally. Model and effort belong
  to the provider named beside them and are refused without one, because a
  model id written for one provider must never attach to another
  ([Coding conventions](../AGENTS.md)). An incoherent pair — a model for a
  provider with no model flag, an effort outside the provider's published
  vocabulary — is a `400` at request time, checked against the same rules
  compact provider selectors are parsed with, rather than a stage that fails at
  spawn and parks the task. An override is also refused (`400`) when the
  advance dispatches the current stage's post, because the transition then
  happens on that post's completion and the override would be dropped at that
  boundary, and when the advance closes the task past its final stage, where
  there is no stage left to spawn. `nextStageProviderSource` (`operator` | `manager` | `agent`)
  declares *who picked the model*, which is deliberately separate from
  `source`: a human accepting a plan agent's builder-tier recommendation
  advances as `operator` with the override sourced to `agent`. The whole
  override is stored on the spawned `stage_run` and returned as
  `latestRun.providerOverride` (`{source, provider, model?, effort?}`), so the
  durable record answers who chose the successor's model. A run that reproduces
  a recorded run — a rerun, resume, or revision resume — carries that record
  forward with the stamp it reproduces.

### Anonymous push pairing certificate

The pairing claim response keeps the compact `KANNA1:{DESKTOP-ID}:{CODE}` QR
payload unchanged and additively returns `desktopPushIdentity` and
`pushPairingCert`. The identity contains the raw 32-byte Ed25519 public key as
unpadded base64url plus the desktop's relay URL and environment. The
certificate contains `deviceId`, Unix-millisecond `issuedAt` and `expiresAt`
(730 days apart), and the raw 64-byte Ed25519 signature as unpadded base64url.

The canonical signed bytes are the ASCII domain
`kanna.push-pairing-cert.v1` followed by one NUL byte and compact JSON with
fields in this exact order:
`{"deviceId":...,"issuedAt":...,"expiresAt":...}`. This is the relay's
proof that the desktop consented to bind that paired device to its anonymous
push identity.

`kanna-server` creates the private identity on first use in a mode-0600 JSON
file beside the configured pairing store. A device paired before this surface
may obtain and persist its first certificate through authenticated
`POST /v1/pairing/push-certificate`; later calls transparently re-issue it with
a fresh 730-day lifetime. The pairing store records which public identity
issued a device's certificate. If the private key is lost or deliberately
rotated, that marker no longer matches and re-issue returns `409`; recovery is
a new LAN pairing ceremony, which binds the device to the new identity.

Task-list rows are deliberately bounded summaries. `prompt` contains at most
500 characters; `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}` is the full-prompt surface.
Task detail also returns `ports: [{name, port}] | null` from the task's current
claimed-port rows. Mobile treats field absence as an older desktop and `null`
as a preview-capable desktop with no declared port.
`waitingPromptSnippet` is the canonical latest-output preview key (the server
still accepts the deprecated `snippet` key when aggregating an older peer, but
does not serialize both). `agent` is the name recorded on the latest durable
`stage_run`; `agentType` is only the session transport (`pty` or `agent`) and
must not be presented as the agent name. Recent listings accept `repoId` and a
`limit` (default 50, clamped to 200); search accepts the same repository
filter. The MCP adapter supplies the calling task's repository by default and
leaves the account-wide `all_machines` behavior unchanged; `all_repos` is the
explicit local cross-repository escape hatch.

Task-detail git history is computed against the same resolved base as the task
diff: an unqualified base prefers `origin/<base>` over local `<base>`, including
when the local branch exists but is stale. If a task's persisted base no longer
resolves, stats retry the repo's current default branch. When neither resolves,
`commitsAhead` and `commitsBehind` are omitted and `baseRefUnresolved: true` is
reported; this must not be interpreted as zero work. `dirty` remains an
independent working-tree result.

### Remote repository checkout

Authenticated repo inventory includes an optional, credential-free `remoteUrl`
alongside the cross-machine `remoteUrlHash`. HTTP(S) origins containing userinfo
or query/fragment data are treated as credential-bearing and their raw values
are never serialized. `POST /v1/repo-checkouts` independently rejects those
sources before git, filesystem, or database work, accepts ordinary HTTPS,
SSH/scp-style, and `file://` sources, verifies the URL's SHA-256 identity, and
starts a non-blocking clone into the desktop convention
`~/.kanna/repos/<name>[-N]`. The worker uses the same `MobileApi::add_repo`
registration path as `POST /v1/repos`, then persists the remote metadata.

The returned operation is polled through
`GET /v1/repo-checkouts/{operation_id}`. A failed clone or registration removes
the operation-owned destination and rolls back any row it inserted. Git uses
only credentials already configured on the target desktop; this API neither
forwards nor provisions credentials. Checkout errors do not echo the clone
source and direct the user to configure a credential-free origin plus git
credentials on the named target desktop. Relay invocation is a control operation: repository
bytes flow directly from the git remote to the target desktop, not through the
relay.

### Repository default-branch metadata

Repository registration treats `git ls-remote --symref origin HEAD` as the
authoritative default branch whenever `origin` exists. Local branch and HEAD
heuristics apply only to repositories without `origin`. The repo row stores
both `default_branch` and `default_branch_source`; repo detail responses expose
the provenance as `defaultBranchSource`.

`PATCH /v1/repos/{repo_id}` accepts `defaultBranch` for an explicit in-place
correction. `POST /v1/repos/{repo_id}/reconcile-metadata` re-detects the branch,
reports the recorded and detected values and provenance plus `drift`, and
updates the existing row by default (`apply: false` is the read-only doctor
mode). The agent-facing surface is `kanna_reconcile_repo_metadata`. Neither
path changes the repo id or its tasks.

Definition resolution reads the exact recorded `origin/<default_branch>`
snapshot. If `origin` exists but that ref does not, resolution fails with the
repo id, branch provenance, and reconciliation guidance; it must not treat a
missing snapshot as permission to fall back to bundled definitions.

## Multi-machine Agent Routing

`kanna-mcp` and `kanna-cli` remain clients of the machine-local
`kanna-server`; agent processes never receive Firebase credentials and do not
connect to the cloud relay themselves. Their shared tool catalog declares
`kanna_list_machines` (`GET /v1/cloud/desktops`) and an optional `machine_id`
on every routable tool. Machine discovery itself and the local-run-bound
`kanna_complete_stage` omit that property. In the CLI,
the same surface is available as `kanna-cli machine list` and
`kanna-cli tool call <tool> --machine-id <id>`. Omitting `machine_id` preserves
local behavior. Both adapters compare an explicit id with the live desktop id
from the local server first: naming the current machine takes the local path
and never requires relay discovery or availability. A different id wraps the
catalog-resolved HTTP request through
`POST /v1/cloud/desktops/{desktop_id}/invoke`.

Those two bridge routes require a real desktop-loopback request
(`DesktopLocalAccess`). A paired LAN client or an inbound relay request cannot
use one trusted desktop as a proxy into the rest of the account. The local
server submits the request through its existing desktop-authenticated relay
socket; the relay resolves that credential to one user and routes only to a
desktop socket registered under the same user. No raw server URL, device
secret, desktop secret, or Firebase token enters the MCP arguments.

The relay connection is also the availability boundary. Machine discovery
always returns the current machine and reports `relayAvailable` plus an error
when sibling discovery is unavailable. Remote calls fail closed when the
target is offline or the relay disconnects. The server enables the bridge only
after `auth_ok` advertises `desktopRouting` capability version 1, so deploying
the desktop ahead of the relay fails fast instead of hanging. That capability is
also the entitlement's: with relay enforcement on, an unentitled account is
advertised neither it nor `tunnelServices`, and a sibling `invoke` sent anyway
is refused with 4402 (`docs/specs/accounts-and-billing.md`, Decision 5). Outstanding and
queued requests are bound to that relay-connection generation and fail instead
of being replayed after reconnect. Task waits retain the normal 240-second MCP
window, with the server-side relay handoff bounded below the MCP client's
300-second tool-call deadline.

Desktop relay establishment — TCP, TLS, WebSocket upgrade, and authentication —
has one 15-second budget. A timeout abandons the socket and enters the normal
five-second reconnect backoff. The local reconnect action races both the
account-auth probe and primary establishment, so it can cancel a connection
that has not reached the established-session loop. While routing is
unavailable, machine discovery preserves the concrete connection reason;
establishment timeout and local cancellation are reported distinctly as
`desktop relay connect timed out` and
`desktop relay connect cancelled by local reconnect request`.

The local `GET /v1/task-events` surface is the account-wide event boundary for
a caller presenting the server's local task-event bearer credential or a
paired device credential. The server creates `task-events.token` beside its
pairing store with mode 0600; task sessions receive only its path through
`KANNA_TASK_EVENTS_TOKEN_PATH`, and Kanna MCP/CLI plus the documented Node
watcher read it and attach `Authorization: Bearer ...` to the local request.
Loopback peer addresses and browser metadata grant no account-wide authority:
an unauthenticated loopback request, including one arriving through DNS rebinding,
receives only the native local feed. When desktop relay routing is available
and `localOnly` is absent, the server starts one native wait for itself and
every active sibling desktop returned by the existing authenticated relay
session. An unpaired LAN caller is refused by the HTTP guard and receives no local or
sibling task metadata. Tunneled
peer waits are marked by the HTTP dispatcher and stay
native, so aggregation cannot recurse. Every aggregated event gains
`machineId`; the `ks1.` cursor binds the scope and connected desktop identity
and carries one opaque native cursor per machine. There is no fabricated
global order across SQLite databases: order is exact within each `machineId`
sequence space.

The server retains unfinished peer long-polls between calls, including when a
caller changes its response limit, rather than cancelling the local receiver
while the peer still holds a long-poll permit. A response larger than the
current aggregate limit advances that machine's native cursor only through the
last event actually emitted; the remainder is fetched on subsequent calls.
Abandoned
sessions expire after ten minutes even if no caller returns, and the registry
holds at most 256 sessions; both expiry and capacity eviction actively abort
their retained legs and buffered payloads. A cursor also retains every machine
observed during the wait. If a known peer is absent or a relay invoke fails,
the response includes a `machineErrors` entry with
`machineId` and `stale: true`, does not advance that peer's cursor, and returns
`waitOutcome: "partial"` when no events are ready. When the peer reconnects,
the next call resumes from that native cursor and catches up wherever the
peer's 14-day retained history still covers the gap. Thus a quiet reachable
peer (no error) is distinguishable from an unreachable peer.

Repository rows are installation-local, so aggregate repo waits never send the
caller's `repoId` to peers. The source resolves it to `repo.remote_url_hash` and
every native sub-wait filters by that hash. `repoRemoteUrlHash` exposes the
same canonical scope directly for a caller that has no local row. A repository
without a remote URL hash cannot be matched across machines and is rejected
while aggregation is active rather than silently becoming local-only.

Native numeric, p1, and p3 cursors remain accepted. A native cursor supplied
as aggregation becomes available initializes the local watermark and starts
new peers from retained history. A server that has no relay route keeps the
native cursor shape and, for an account-wide-authorized caller, adds a
relay-unavailable `machineErrors` warning.
Agent-facing catalog calls set `shortCursor=true`. The server then retains the
full native or `ks1.` checkpoint behind a durable
`kh1.<issuer>.<nonce>` handle, where both fields are eight hex digits and the
issuer identifies the server that minted it. Each successful resume advances
that same handle, so a busy watcher does not accumulate abandoned entries or
evict its live checkpoint. The mapping is stored in the server database and
survives server and relay restarts; abandoned mappings are pruned with the
14-day event-retention window.

A handle is only resolvable on the server that issued it — its process cache
and its `task_event_cursor_handle` rows are local — and the two ways it can
fail to resolve are answered differently, because they are different faults:

- **This server issued it and no longer holds it.** The wait **restarts from
  retained history and returns a new handle**, reporting `cursorReset: true`
  and a `cursorResetReason` naming the handle. This is the recovery the
  response used to instruct the caller to perform; the server performs it
  instead, because a caller that re-armed mechanically got an instantaneous,
  permanent 400 it could repeat at machine speed. One did, ~100 times a second
  for eleven hours, writing 22.8 GB of one identical line. Nothing is lost:
  the handle only stops resolving once its checkpoint has aged out, and
  retained history is replayed in full.
- **Another machine issued it.** The wait is refused with `400` naming the
  issuing token and this server, because no retry here can ever resolve it and
  this server's retained history is not what the caller is watching. That
  refusal is a routing fault — the wait belongs on the issuing machine — not
  an expiry, and it must never be reported as one.

A handle-resolution failure remains distinct from a native cursor whose event
position predates retained history. Callers
that omit `shortCursor` keep receiving the deployed stateless
cursor shapes, and numeric, `p1.`, `p3.`, `kc1.`, and `ks1.` inputs remain
accepted; resuming one with short cursors enabled upgrades the response.
`localOnly=true` is the explicit compatibility escape hatch used by adapters
that already own a per-machine fan-in; inbound relay invokes are local-only by
transport provenance regardless of the query.

`kanna_wait_events` retains its earlier MCP-side fan-in behavior. When its
explicit `task_ids` belong to several reachable machines and `machine_id` is
omitted, MCP discovers each task's owner, starts one native cursor wait per
owner, and returns as soon as any owner has events. Every returned event gains
`machineId`. Its legacy `km1.` aggregate cursor records the immutable
task-to-machine grouping plus each server's opaque native cursor. New responses
expose that checkpoint as a process-local `kmh1.` plus eight-hex-digit handle;
old `km1.` values remain accepted and upgrade on resume. An unknown or expired
handle tells the caller to omit it and replay retained history. The MCP process
retains the other in-flight long polls and
reuses them on the next call, rather than cancelling them, abandoning relay
work, or replacing the server event feed with client polling. If MCP restarts,
the aggregate cursor contains enough state to recreate those waits without
losing events. Machine failures are returned in `machineErrors` without
advancing that machine's cursor or discarding events received elsewhere. A 400
that identifies an invalid or expired embedded machine cursor instead
invalidates the aggregate call and gives the cursor-less recovery, rather than
returning a partial continuation that can only fail again.

On every aggregate-cursor resume, kanna-mcp compares the cursor's claimed
`localMachineId` with the live local server identity before using its ownership
map or native cursors. A cursor copied from another machine, made stale by an
identity change, or tampered to relabel the local sequence space is rejected.
Local-versus-remote event routing uses that same live identity, never the
cursor's self-asserted value.

MCP marks each of those native sub-waits `localOnly=true`, so its established
`km1.` sessions do not recursively enter the server `ks1.` fan-in or duplicate
remote events. New `repo_id`, `repo_remote_url_hash`, and `parent_task_id`
calls flow through the local server and therefore use `ks1.` aggregation.
Passing `machine_id` pins any scope to that one machine and returns its native
cursor.
There is no global ordering between independent SQLite sequence spaces;
ordering remains exact within each machine and `machineId` identifies the
sequence space for every aggregated event.

Task discovery follows the same explicit machine model. Recent-task and search
routes accept `allMachines=true`; that response contains `tasks`, with a
`machineId` on every row, plus `machineErrors` so a partial account view is
never silent. Both routes accept `includeClosed=true`. A local task-detail miss
checks reachable siblings and, when the id exists elsewhere, returns an error
that names the owning machine and tells MCP callers to repeat
`kanna_get_task` with that `machine_id`, rather than returning a bare 404.

`GET /v1/machine-stats` (`kanna_machine_stats`, `kanna-cli machine stats`) is
an observational resource snapshot, not a scheduler or a safe-to-start quota.
The server owns native collection; MCP and CLI relay the same JSON. Existing
load, memory, `cpuCoreCount`, `heavyProcessCount`/`heavyProcesses`, and
`busyTaskCount` fields remain compatible. New fields are optional for old peers:
**absent means unknown, never a healthy zero**.

- `cpu`: a real two-point CPU-counter sample. `busyPercent` is user + system,
  `userPercent` includes nice time, and `systemPercent` includes Linux IRQ and
  softirq time. Percentages use **0–100 for the whole machine**, independently
  of core count. macOS uses `host_statistics(HOST_CPU_LOAD_INFO)`;
  busy + idle = 100. Linux uses `/proc/stat`; busy + idle + `ioWaitPercent` +
  `stealPercent` = 100. Guest counters already belong to user/nice and are not
  counted twice. I/O wait and stolen VM time are not available execution
  capacity. CPU counters are OS accounting estimates, not throughput or
  frequency measurements. No first-read utilization is published: a fresh
  request establishes a baseline, waits 500 ms, then samples. A zero delta,
  reset/wrap (including decreasing Linux iowait), topology change, failed
  counter, or elapsed window outside 500–5000 ms omits `cpu` and records why.
- `loadAverages` remains 1/5/15-minute OS load, not a percent. Linux load includes
  runnable and uninterruptible tasks; neither low load nor zero recognized
  builds establishes idle CPU. `physicalCoreCount` counts physical cores and
  `logicalCoreCount` counts online logical CPUs visible to the host counters.
  The legacy `cpuCoreCount` remains physical-first, falling back to the server's
  available parallelism (then 1); new counts have no invented fallback. SMT,
  Apple performance/efficiency cores, frequency, thermal limits, CPU affinity,
  and container quotas mean these counts are not interchangeable capacity units.
  Linux readings describe the visible host/proc namespace, not a cgroup quota.
- `processes.topProcesses`: union of the five highest sampled CPU and five
  highest resident-memory consumers, deduplicated by PID, ordered by CPU, at
  most ten rows. Includes WindowServer, VMs, shells, services and other non-build
  consumers. Each row has `pid`, `parentPid`, a bounded native `name`,
  `cpuPercent`, `sampleWindowMs`, and `residentBytes`. **Process 100% means one
  logical CPU**, so 424% is about 4.24 logical CPUs, not 424% of the machine.
  Each process uses its own elapsed monotonic interval and PID/start identity.
  A missing baseline or counter reset yields null CPU/window, not idle. RSS is
  resident physical memory (macOS `pti_resident_size`, Linux stat RSS pages),
  includes shared pages, excludes swapped-out pages and is not additive.
  Processes born after enumeration or gone before the second read are not
  fully represented; protected/kernel processes may deny counters. Do not sum
  process CPU or RSS to reconstruct aggregate CPU/memory. The summary reports
  observed, sampled and unavailable counts and truncation (8192 inspected PIDs;
  when truncated, observed count is a lower bound). Process errors explicitly
  mean partial coverage. Arguments are inspected privately only for recognized
  Node-family runners, never returned; no environment is collected.
- Legacy `heavyProcessCount`/`heavyProcesses` are **recognized build/test
  process counts**, not a count of all heavy consumers or a utilization metric.
  Categories remain rustc, cargo, bazel/bazelisk, vitest, xcodebuild, and Node
  tests (Jest, Mocha, Ava, Tap, Playwright test, `--test`). Direct named runners,
  nodejs and Bun wrappers are recognized too. Wrapper titles, truncated process
  names, inaccessible argv, build tools outside this list and exited processes
  can be missed; zero only means no recognized tools were observed.
  `busyTaskCount` still counts open durable tasks whose runtime state is busy;
  it is neither host utilization nor a count of active child processes.

`sampledAt` is the source machine's snapshot completion time in Unix
milliseconds; `collectionWindowMs` is total monotonic collection duration.
`cpu.sampleStartedAt`/`cpu.sampledAt` are wall-clock timestamps enclosing its
counter pair, and `cpu.sampleWindowMs` is the actual monotonic elapsed interval,
not the requested sleep. Process samples overlap that pair but include their
own scan offsets. Memory/storage/load are point reads during collection, not an
atomic system snapshot. `cacheAgeMs` is monotonic age since collection completion
at the source when it answered; cache hits are at most two seconds old. Relay
transit adds age. Compare timestamps with awareness of machine clock skew;
there is no guarantee that sibling windows coincide or capacity remains free.

Collection runs on a blocking worker, never an async request thread. Concurrent
requests share one collector and its two-second cache, including failures. A
local request waits at most two seconds; timing out or disconnecting does not
release worker ownership or start another collector while the old one is still
running. There is no periodic sampling process. Native OS/filesystem calls may
outlive that request deadline; at most one collector is retained by the server.
No shell tools or build-machine runtime dependencies are required.

Memory fields are bytes, with `source` and `collectionErrors` describing their
availability. `freeBytes` is unused memory; `availableBytes` estimates reclaimable
headroom and is the more useful value for assessing memory demand, but does not
promise it can all be allocated. On Linux these are `/proc/meminfo` MemFree and
MemAvailable, with used = total − available. macOS preserves sysinfo 0.33's
legacy definitions in checked native reads: free = (free pages − speculative)
× page size; used = (active + wired + compressor + speculative) × page size;
available = max(0, free + inactive + purgeable − compressor) × page size.
These estimates are **not complementary partitions**; total − used need not
match available. `compressedBytes` on macOS is physical compressor occupancy,
not the uncompressed size of stored pages; it is already included in used.
`swapTotalBytes`/`swapUsedBytes` show occupied swap capacity (not swap rates).
macOS `pressure` is the kernel's normal/warning/critical category, which describes
memory only, not CPU. Linux does not fabricate a categorical pressure or a
system-wide compressed-byte figure; absent counters and unsupported metrics
are explained in memory `collectionErrors`.

`storage` probes at most 16 visible repo roots, their conventional `.build` and
`.tmp` paths, and the server's OS-temp path. These are locations, not a claim to
resolve arbitrary build configuration or every task's external cache. For a
missing path it reports the nearest existing ancestor as `measuredPath`; errors
and the repository cap are explicit. One row per filesystem device contains its
role/path associations: duplicate repo/build/temp volumes are not counted
again. `availableBytes` is statvfs space available to an unprivileged caller,
`freeBytes` also includes reserved space, and `readOnly` is explicit. APFS volumes
can share container space even across different device ids, so **do not sum
rows** or assume purgeable space, quotas, sparse allocations, and snapshots
behave identically to `df`. Storage inspection does not walk repositories.

Sibling calls use `localOnly=true`, a three-second listing deadline and parallel
three-second per-peer deadlines, capped at 16 peers. The envelope has one row
per successful machine, plus `machineErrors` for failed local collection,
unreachable/incompatible/malformed peers, peer-reported collection errors and
omitted peers. A failed local collector does not discard successful siblings.
Per-metric failures appear in the machine's `collectionErrors` or memory errors;
missing fields in an old server response remain missing through aggregation.
Responses bound process rows, path associations and diagnostic strings. The
existing loopback/browser-credential, paired-LAN and authenticated-relay
boundaries apply unchanged.

and [Apple task accounting](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/main/doc/observability/recount.md).

Repository singleton signals use that authenticated desktop-routing boundary
before local creation. A repository row with `remote_url_hash` is identified
account-wide by that hash plus the singleton agent name; local repository ids
never cross machines. Cloud task snapshots persist the synthetic
`singletonAgent` beside each open singleton, so the relay-backed directory can
name owners whose desktops are already offline. Current publishers also stamp
`singletonDirectoryVersion: 1`; a registered desktop without that stamp makes
directory resolution fail closed until it publishes a current snapshot. The receiving server combines
that directory with its local database and every active sibling's native
lookup; a successful live lookup replaces stale directory state for that
machine. After all three sources prove absence, the requesting server proposes
a task id and atomically creates a relay-owned Firestore claim keyed by
`remoteUrlHash + agent` before it writes the local task. Concurrent first
signals therefore elect exactly one requesting desktop; a loser observes the
winning machine and task and either routes to an already-published owner or
fails closed while that task is still being prepared. Preparation failure
releases only the matching unpublished reservation; a persisted task keeps its
claim. The reservation records a random creator-process fence generated once
by the claiming `kanna-server` and included in both its claim commands and
complete cloud snapshots. The fence survives ordinary relay disconnects and
publication-session rollover, so an empty snapshot after reconnect cannot
clear a claim while the original HTTP request can still persist its task. If
that server crashes after acquisition but before SQLite persistence, its
replacement process publishes a different fence; only a complete snapshot
from that same desktop with the different process fence may clear the
reservation, and only when the proposed task id is absent. A snapshot carrying
the reservation's fence, a snapshot without a fence, or any other desktop's
snapshot is not authoritative for this purpose. Explicit failure cleanup is
also fenced to the creator process and the matching machine/task identity.
Cloud snapshot reconciliation promotes a matching reservation to a durable owner.
Closing a singleton removes its local ownership in the same SQLite transaction
that writes `closed_at`; there is no separate local claim table. The cloud
projection is a separate database: its task removal and conditional claim
release now commit in one Firestore transaction, fenced by publication session
and sequence and by the old machine/task identity. SQLite and Firestore are not
one distributed transaction. Before account-wide discovery, the requesting
server publishes its current snapshot and awaits the relay acknowledgement;
reachable siblings do the same before replying to native singleton lookup.
Thus the subsequent claim sees a known close without waiting for the periodic
publisher. Publication failure returns a specific 503 and creates nothing.

An absent or unowned claim is reclaimable, including a present record without
an owner identifier. In this protocol `desktopId` identifies the publishing
desktop document, `ownerDesktopId` identifies a published task's owner, and
`machineId` identifies the claim's owner. They are not interchangeable optional
fields on one record. An `owned` claim whose task is absent from that owner's
complete authoritative directory is also reclaimable. The relay re-reads the
directory and claim within its claim transaction and replaces unowned/stale
records with the new fenced reservation. Two simultaneous requesters therefore
still elect one master. A `reserved` claim remains exclusive until the existing
creator-fence recovery rules prove its creator is gone. There is one additional
positive proof: its task has committed a local close. The close lifecycle sends
the existing conditional reservation release with its creator fence, covering
creation followed by close before the first task publication. If that release
failed, a later handoff asks the claiming desktop to prove the reserved task
closed and release it with its own fence, then re-enters arbitration. The local
case calls this directly; siblings use the privileged internal
`POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/actions/release-closed-singleton-reservation` route,
which returns false for an open or nonexistent task and never closes a task. This never clears an
unpersisted creator or an open task; a failed release is logged and a restart
still uses the existing different-process-fence recovery.

One remote match receives the message through the existing task-input route.
Two or more open matches return a conflict naming every `machineId:taskId`.
An open owner on an unreachable desktop remains owned: a 503 names the task,
owner machine, and failed operation. Missing/incomplete directory information,
failed publication, and an in-progress reservation also have distinct 503
reasons; none proves a safe takeover. No implicit takeover of a potentially
live task is permitted.

Operators/managers deliberately re-seed a Merge Master with
`kanna_signal_merge_handoff` for the source task, or `kanna_signal_agent` with
`agent: "merge"` and an initial request. Other singleton agents use the latter
surface with their agent name. These are find-or-create recovery operations:
all pass through the same account-wide arbitration. Synthetic `singleton-*`
workflows remain internal implementation definitions, not independently
creatable resources that could bypass ownership. The ordinary task creation
workflow name is not the recovery API.
Repositories without `remote_url_hash` have no cross-machine identity and
deliberately keep the original per-machine behavior. A desktop without an
account credential likewise has no sibling namespace; when account routing
exists but is temporarily unavailable, uncertainty is an error rather than
permission to duplicate.

## Task Transfer Transport

`kanna-server` owns the `kanna-task-transfer` sidecar: it spawns the process,
holds its stdin/stdout control plane, and terminates both directions of the
relay. It spawns lazily — on the first control request or on an inbound
task-transfer tunnel — and respawns transparently once the previous child is
observed dead. Before this, the desktop process held the pipe, which made every
transfer depend on an open, signed-in window.

These routes are **not** part of the LAN surface. Unlike the rest of
`/v1/transfers/*`, which a paired LAN device may reach, each one requires a
direct desktop loopback connection (`DesktopLocalAccess`): they initiate
pairing and move tasks between machines, and their pre-move equivalent was
reachable only by whoever held a private stdio pipe.

- `POST /v1/transfers/sidecar/control/{operation}` — one control operation from
  a fixed allowlist (`crates/kanna-server/src/transfer_control.rs`), taking and
  returning camelCase JSON. The route cannot hand the sidecar an arbitrary
  message.
- `GET /v1/transfers/sidecar/events?cursor=...&streamId=...&timeoutSecs=...&limit=...`
  — long-poll of sidecar events, following the `/v1/task-events` cursor
  contract: pass the returned cursor back and nothing fired between two calls is
  missed. Unlike `/v1/task-events`, whose cursor is a durable `task_event.seq`,
  this log is in memory and its sequence restarts at zero with every server
  process — while the desktop that holds the cursor outlives those restarts. So
  a cursor should be sent back with the `streamId` it was issued with: a cursor
  presented alongside a `streamId` naming a *different* stream is discarded and
  answered with `missedEvents`, rather than applied to sequence numbers it never
  referred to. A cursor sent with no `streamId` at all — what a desktop from
  before this field existed sends — is honoured under the original sequence
  semantics instead, because refusing it would mean never pruning: the caller
  would be redelivered the same retained events indefinitely while durable
  entries climbed to the cap and backpressured the sidecar reader, wedging
  control. Absence of the field is not evidence of a stale cursor.
  Single-consumer: a read prunes through the cursor it is given, so exactly one
  desktop process subscribes. This feed carries only *advisory* events —
  pairing progress and remote terminal frames. The state-mutating events
  (`incoming_transfer_request`, `task_pull_requested`, `task_pull_refused`,
  `outgoing_transfer_committed`, `outgoing_transfer_finalization_requested`)
  never reach it: the sidecar's stdout reader appends them straight to the
  transfer engine's durable work queue in this process. A full advisory log
  evicts its oldest entries and says so via `missedEvents`, which it could not
  do while a lifecycle event might be among them.
- `POST /v1/transfers/cloud-proxies`, `DELETE /v1/transfers/cloud-proxies`,
  `DELETE /v1/transfers/cloud-proxies/{peer_id}` — outbound cloud transfer
  tunnels. This cannot ride the server's own relay connection: the relay honours
  `tunnel_request` only from a socket authenticated with a Firebase user
  `id_token`, and the server authenticates as a *desktop* with its device token
  or desktop secret. The signed-in renderer holds the only Firebase credential,
  so it pushes and rotates the ID token through the first route.

Identity and port have one owner each, and it is the desktop: it derives
`transfer_port` into `server.toml` (the same value the inbound tunnel bridge
dials), and resolves `transfer/identity.json`, the peer id, the display name and
the registry directory into the server's environment at spawn. `kanna-server`
forwards all of it to the sidecar and re-derives none of it, so staging and
production keep the distinct ports and per-worktree registries they need to run
side by side.

## Task Transfer Orchestration

`kanna-server` performs the transfer, not just its transport. Push (preflight →
git bundle → artifact staging → insert → commit), incoming record and import
(repository acquisition, artifact materialization, task creation through the
server's own creator, provenance, acknowledgment), approve/reject execution,
outgoing-committed handling (closing the source task through the server's own
close action) and failure reporting all run here.

This is what makes a transfer independent of an open window. Orchestration used
to live in the renderer, elected among windows by a lease/incarnation/phase-claim
protocol whose whole job was surviving that window disappearing — and on
2026-08-06 it did not: ownership was lost before the PTY finalization signal,
the failure report could not be sent, and the commit acknowledgment failed. See
[2026-08-06-task-transfer-rearchitecture-plan.md](2026-08-06-task-transfer-rearchitecture-plan.md).

The engine's steps are rows in `transfer_work`, appended by the same reader
that observes the sidecar event, and drained by one in-process loop:

- A work id is **derived from the event** (`pull:<pull-request-id>`,
  `incoming:<transfer-id>`, `committed:<transfer-id>`,
  `finalize:<transfer-id>`), so a redelivery collapses onto the work already
  queued. At-least-once delivery to a window became exactly-once execution in
  one process.
- A step that must happen at most once — typing into the source agent, closing
  the source task, acknowledging an import — claims a row in
  `transfer_work_phase`. That is the durable form of the sidecar's in-memory
  `claimed_phases`, so a resumed item continues rather than repeating. A step
  whose *answer* cannot be recomputed on a retry — what the source session
  looked like before it was shut down, and whether the shutdown was clean —
  records that answer in the same table, first writer wins.
- Work left `running` by a dead process returns to `pending` at engine start,
  and incoming transfers recorded but not imported are re-enqueued. Before this,
  only `transfer-request` had any restart recovery at all.
- Attempts are bounded and backed off. A transfer that can make no further
  progress is driven to `failed` and its sidecar reservation released, rather
  than retried silently forever.

Clients express **intent**; the engine executes. These routes are ordinary
`/v1/` surface (not `DesktopLocalAccess`-only), so mobile can express the same
intents:

- `POST /v1/tasks/{source_task_id}/actions/push-to-peer` —
  `{targetMachine | peerId, transport?, cloudFallback?, targetDesktopId?, intentKey?}`.
  `intentKey` distinguishes a deliberate re-push from a retried request; the
  response's `scheduled: false` means the intent was already queued, or that the
  task already has a transfer in flight (`state: "already_in_flight"`, with the
  transfer named in `activeTransfer`).
- `POST /v1/transfers/actions/pull-task` — `DesktopLocalAccess` only; see
  "Agent-facing task transfer" below.
- `POST /v1/transfers/{transfer_id}/actions/approve`
- `POST /v1/transfers/{transfer_id}/actions/reject-incoming`
- `POST /v1/transfers/{transfer_id}/actions/dismiss-failure` — marks a `failed`
  transfer read so it stops marking its task; the record itself survives.

Progress reaches the UI through the snapshot's `transfer_status`, which the
sidebar already renders. There is no bespoke event protocol between the engine
and a window, and no window is required for a transfer to complete.

### Agent-facing task transfer

Choosing *where* a task goes used to be arithmetic only a signed-in renderer
could do. `desktopTransferMachines.ts` merged the sidecar's LAN peer list with
the account's cloud machine list, decided which transport each machine
preferred, and handed `push-to-peer` a peer id plus three routing options —
so `push-to-peer` was reachable by an agent but not *usable* by one. On
2026-09-06 a task manager asked to move a task between two of the operator's
own machines found no MCP transfer tool and no `kanna-cli task push`, read the
desktop source, posted a scraped peer id at the route, and reported the task
moved on a `scheduled: true` while the transfer was dying on a relay socket.

`transfer_targets.rs` performs that merge in the server, over the two things
this process already owns — the sidecar's peer registry and the cloud transfer
proxies it binds — and four catalog tools expose it. Every one has a matching
`kanna-cli` command, because the CLI is the fallback surface for a client
without MCP:

| Tool | CLI | Route |
|---|---|---|
| `kanna_list_transfer_peers` | `machine transfer-peers` | `GET /v1/transfers/peers` |
| `kanna_push_task` | `task push` | `POST /v1/tasks/{id}/actions/push-to-peer` |
| `kanna_pull_task` | `task pull` | `POST /v1/transfers/actions/pull-task` |
| `kanna_task_transfers` | `task transfers` | `GET /v1/tasks/{id}/transfers` |

These things are contract rather than convenience:

- **A destination is canonical identity.** `to_machine` / `from_machine` accept
  a machine (desktop) id from `kanna_list_machines` or a transfer peer id from
  `kanna_list_transfer_peers`, and nothing else. A display name is not identity.
  A peer trusted only by LAN pairing has no account-wide machine id, which is
  why both spellings resolve; a same-account sibling carries the machine id its
  provisioned cloud route names. Public keys, endpoints and relay credentials
  are never in an agent-facing payload.
- **Direction decides where the call runs.** A push runs on the machine that
  owns the task, so it is routable with `machine_id` — that is how a task moves
  between two *other* machines. A pull moves a task onto the calling machine and
  keeps the `DesktopLocalAccess` boundary the rest of the sidecar control plane
  has, so it declares no `machine_id` at all. `GET /v1/transfers/peers` is
  `PrivilegedTaskAccess` and routable, so an agent can ask a sibling what it can
  reach before pushing from there.
- **A scheduled intent is never a completed move.** Both answers carry
  `moved: false`, a `state` (`scheduled` / `already_queued` /
  `already_in_flight`, and `requested` / `already_requested`), and a `nextStep`
  naming `kanna_task_transfers`. That surface reports each transfer's raw
  engine `status` alongside the coarse `pending` / `completed` / `failed` /
  `rejected` verdict, and ties the task's two ids together through
  `sourceTaskId` and `localTaskId`. A pull's `requestId` is stable for repeats
  within the sidecar's five-minute window, so an unchanged id is a duplicate
  rather than a second move.
- **A refused pull is recorded on the machine that asked.** A pull is answered
  synchronously with a request id and fulfilled minutes later by the *source's*
  engine, so a source that refuses has no reply left to travel back on. It
  therefore reports the refusal as its own peer request, and the requester
  records it as a `failed` incoming transfer with a `sourceTaskId` and no
  `localTaskId` — nothing arrived and nothing will. `kanna_task_transfers`
  answers for that source id even though no such task exists here, which is
  what it used to answer 404 to, and the snapshot carries the row as a
  `transferAlerts` entry so a window has something to show for a move it
  started. Best effort in one direction only: the refusal is already durable on
  the source, and a requester that cannot be reached never turns a refusal into
  retried work.
- **A transfer failure is reported until it is read.** Nothing else retires
  one — the move that would have replaced it is the one that did not happen —
  so a task wore its `⇄✗` marker for the rest of its life.
  `POST /v1/transfers/{transfer_id}/actions/dismiss-failure` marks a `failed`
  transfer read (`dismissedAt` on the summary), which stops the marker and the
  alert without touching the record; a later `completed` transfer of the same
  task retires it on its own. Only a `failed` transfer may be dismissed: an
  in-flight one is the current truth about the task, and hiding it would lose
  the move.
- **A route that cannot carry the transfer is refused before anything is
  queued.** The relay authenticates every tunnel dial, and the Firebase
  credential it dials with is minted by the signed-in renderer and pushed to
  `POST /v1/transfers/cloud-proxies`; nothing in the server can refresh it. A
  cloud route whose credential has expired therefore produced `scheduled: true`
  followed by `expected auth_ok text frame` on a socket nobody was watching. The
  server now reads that credential's own `exp` (`cloud_transfer_proxy.rs`), and
  a cloud route inside the expiry margin is reported unusable — with the fix,
  which is starting a transfer from the signed-in desktop app on that machine
  (it refreshes the route as it goes), or using the LAN while both machines
  share a network. What that check reads is strictly *this* machine's outbound
  credential: a transfer that just arrived here was dialled with the other
  machine's, so an incoming move proves nothing about the route reported here.
  A stale cloud route behind a healthy LAN route costs only the fallback, and
  the response says so rather than downgrading silently. A cloud-routed *pull* additionally depends on the source
  machine's own credential, which this machine cannot see; the tool description
  says so.

### Source finalization

A push cannot ship a conversation the source agent is still writing to, so the
engine shuts that agent down first — by **typing at it**, not by signalling it
(`transfer_engine/finalize.rs`):

1. inject a wrap-up message through the same two-step input helper every other
   Kanna input path uses (`task_input.rs`: the text as one write, 150 ms, then a
   lone CR so it registers as a discrete Enter);
2. wait for the daemon to report the session `Idle` — `Waiting` is a permission
   prompt, not idleness;
3. inject the provider's quit command (`AgentProvider::quit_command`);
4. wait for the daemon `Exit`, and only then stage artifacts.

Nothing is typed while the session is `Waiting`. Step 3 gets that from step 2 —
it is only reached on `Idle` — but step 1 has nothing in front of it, so the
status the daemon reported at attach is checked before the wrap-up goes out. The
helper's trailing CR is the keystroke that accepts a permission prompt's
highlighted option, so a wrap-up typed at a parked session approves whatever
tool call it is holding, in the operator's name — and silently, because the
agent then resumes, goes idle, quits on cue and ships `cleanlyFinalized: true`.
A session already parked when finalization starts degrades immediately instead;
one that parks mid-wrap-up reaches the same rung through the idle timeout.

The old mechanism was a `SIGINT` and a 1500 ms wait, and it could not work on
any session the daemon had **adopted** through a handoff: the daemon refuses
signals for a child it never forked, because the pid cannot be pinned across
`kill(2)`. Every session older than the running daemon is adopted, so after
every app upgrade no pre-existing task could be finalized. `Command::Input` has
no such ownership check, which is what makes injection the mechanism that works
where signalling cannot (pinned in `crates/daemon/tests/handoff.rs`).

Each step appends `task.transfer_finalizing` to the task event feed with a
`payload.phase`, because a wrap-up is legitimately minutes of latency and has to
read as a transfer rather than as a hung task.

That latency is also why `PeerRequest::FinalizeTransfer` has a request window of
its own. Every other peer request is a machine doing its own local work and
fits the ordinary 15 s window; this one is the destination waiting on somebody
else's *agent* being asked to stop. While the two shared a window, any wrap-up
longer than a few seconds surfaced on the destination as `PeerRequestTimeout`,
which is a retriable import failure — so a normal finalization silently spent
attempts from `MAX_TRANSFER_WORK_ATTEMPTS`, the budget held for a locked
OpenCode store or a dropped artifact fetch. The transfer still completed, off
the finalization result the source caches for the retry that collects it, so
nothing failed loudly; only the retry budget was gone.

`finalization_request_timeout` (10 minutes,
`crates/task-transfer/src/runtime/config.rs`) is what the source is given to
answer. The server's own budget must fit inside it — `WRAP_UP_TIMEOUT` plus
`QUIT_EXIT_TIMEOUT` is 6 minutes, leaving the rest for staging the session
artifacts, and a unit test in `finalize.rs` fails if that stops holding. The
destination allows the same window plus one ordinary request window, so the
source's answer — including its own timeout report — always arrives while the
destination is still listening. Injection failure or a session
that never goes idle degrades the finalization — artifacts are staged as they
stand and the payload carries `cleanlyFinalized: false` with the reason —
rather than failing the transfer. Destructive teardown stays last and stays
*after* staging: it is the source task's own close, once the destination has
acknowledged the import.

A payload arrives from another machine, so everything derived from it is fenced
before it is used: the artifact contract
(`transfer_engine/payload.rs`), the openat/`O_NOFOLLOW`/renameat-no-replace
materialization boundary (`transfer_artifact.rs`), and the git argv fence
(`transfer_engine/git.rs`) — a clone URL is checked against a scheme allowlist
and passed after `--`, because `git clone --upload-pack=…` and git's `ext::`
transport are both remote code execution.

## Agent Runtime Identity

`kanna_info` is a catalog-declared, parameterless client tool backed by
`GET /v1/status`; `kanna-cli info` exposes the same result when MCP is not
available. The result deliberately keeps three identities separate:

- `clientAdapter` identifies `kanna-mcp` or `kanna-cli`; MCP results include
  the adapter's MCP protocol version.
- `connection` is client-owned metadata: the exact effective HTTP base URL the
  client is using and its parsed host/port.
- `serverStatus` is an allow-listed snapshot of authoritative server state,
  environment, build version, safe desktop identity, capabilities, and
  write-path health. `lanAdvertisedEndpoint` separately reports the host/port
  advertised by that server, which need not match the actual loopback or relay
  transport endpoint.

The catalog crate owns the status allowlist shared by CLI and MCP. It never
passes the raw `/v1/status` object through, so `pairingCode`, compatibility
aliases, credentials, database paths, unknown future fields, and arbitrary
HTTP error bodies cannot enter the tool result. If status cannot be fetched or
decoded, the tool retains adapter and effective-connection metadata and sets
`serverStatus.available` to `false` with an explicit error; it does not infer
an environment or version. The server route itself is unchanged, preserving
existing mobile and status consumers.

## Agent Definition Discovery

`GET /v1/repos/{repo_id}/agents` and the catalog-backed
`kanna_list_agents` tool list the definitions that the `agent` field of task
creation can run. Names are invokable directory selectors. Descriptions,
default providers, and default models come from the fully resolved definition:
a repo `AGENT.md` wins over a built-in of the same name, then the repo's
`EXTEND.md` is layered on top. `source` is `built_in`, `repo_override`, or
`repo_authored`; extending a built-in counts as a repo override because the
definition that runs is repo-modified. Definitions whose resolved frontmatter
declares `visibility: internal` — the `commit` and `approve` stage posts and
the purpose-built `architect` consultation role Kanna binds itself — are
omitted from the listing, but still resolve when the
`agent` field names them explicitly: visibility governs listing, not access.

The matching `architect-consultation` workflow is internal for the same
reason: it is a finite manual-stage child contract named explicitly by the
task manager, not a product-work workflow choice. The workflow binds
`architect`; task creation supplies the assessed work item as `parentTaskId`
and the assessed committed branch as `baseRef`. The manager observes its
completion through the MCP wait surface. No singleton or new event loop is
involved. See
[Architect Consultations](specs/architect-consultations.md).

Task creation uses that same resolution path for any agent role, not only
specialty reviewers. An explicit request provider wins, followed by the
definition's provider candidates, then the configured user default when the
definition declares none. Role-specific agents can still fail their own
preconditions—for example, `pr` needs committed task work to publish—but Kanna
does not reject them as first-stage bindings.

## Agent Provider Inventory

A desktop reports which agent provider CLIs it can actually run. Kanna supports
a fixed provider set, but a given Mac usually has only some of them installed,
and a task created for a provider whose executable does not resolve there is
accepted, gets a worktree and a branch, and then never connects — the spawn
wraps a command that does not exist. Any client that offers a *choice* of
provider for a remote machine therefore needs the machine's own answer, not the
registry.

The inventory is computed with the same resolution a spawn uses
(`task_creator::resolve_agent_executable`: process PATH, then the cached
login-shell PATH, then live user install locations), memoized for 30 seconds. It
rides on the payloads that already describe a desktop, so no client needs an
extra round trip:

- `GET /v1/status` → `agentProviders` — what a paired LAN client sees, because
  it learns a desktop through its Bonjour status probe and never reads
  `/v1/desktops`.
- `GET /v1/desktops` → `agentProviders` — the directly addressed LAN desktop.
- the cloud task snapshot's `desktop.agentProviders`, which the relay
  shape-validates and stores on the desktop document — the WAN path, read by
  mobile with the rest of the desktop record.

The field is advisory and its three states are distinct. **Absent** means the
desktop predates the field or the record could not carry it: clients fall back
to offering every supported provider, which is the behaviour that shipped before
inventory existed, so a stale or missing inventory never blocks task creation.
**Non-empty** narrows the offer to that list. **Empty** is a reported answer —
that machine can run nothing — and a client should refuse creation with an
explanation rather than offer a choice that will fail. The relay validates
shape, not provider names: it ships separately from the desktop, and a desktop
that learns a new provider must not need a relay deploy.

Mobile's create-task composer consumes it: options come from the selected
machine, the default is that machine's first available provider rather than a
constant, and a selection made for one machine is re-resolved when the machine
changes or a refresh brings a newer inventory.

## Task Event Feed

`GET /v1/task-events` is the surface an orchestrating agent watches instead of
polling each child. Its outer account feed and each native machine feed are
cursor-based, not snapshot-diffed:

- Event order is `task_event.seq` (`INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`). SQLite
  allows one writer at a time, so a `seq` cannot be committed out of order.
  Fixed task/repo cursors are a single sequence watermark. Parent cursors bind
  that same global watermark to the parent id; they are constant-size and do
  not contain child ids or membership history. Callers pass back the cursor
  they were given unchanged; events that fire between two calls arrive on the
  next one. The `ks1` server aggregate and `km1` MCP aggregate both wrap every
  embedded native checkpoint in the same `ke1` per-machine envelope. Deployed
  aggregate cursors with bare numeric, `p3`, `kc1`, or short-handle values stay
  accepted and are canonicalized when resumed.
- Omitting the cursor returns the scope's retained history (14 days), so a
  watcher that starts after its children does not lose their early events.
- Events are appended by the same DB writes that change the state they describe
  (`pipeline_item`, `stage_run`), inside the caller's transaction where there is
  one — the log cannot drift from the state.
- The wait blocks inside the server, bounded by
  `kanna_tool_catalog::MAX_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS`, so `kanna-mcp` and `kanna-cli`
  each issue one plain GET and neither owns a polling loop. The ceiling stays
  240s for every path including MCP: `CLIENT_TOOL_CALL_BUDGET_SECS` is 300s
  because that is where MCP clients abort a `tools/call` and discard its
  result, and a static assertion keeps a minute of headroom under it. Fewer
  calls therefore come from batching what one call returns, not from longer
  ones — see [Batching a task-event wait](#batching-a-task-event-wait).
- `task.awaiting_input` comes from the daemon's `Waiting` session status, which
  is a positive match on a prompt the agent CLI rendered. It is deliberately
  never inferred from a session going quiet; see
  [2026-07-29-awaiting-input-detection-e2e-gap.md](2026-07-29-awaiting-input-detection-e2e-gap.md).
- `task.runtime_changed` is the manager-grade signal, and it covers **every**
  runtime edge — `busy`, `waiting`, `idle`, `exited`. It is based only on the
  daemon runtime dimension, never the sidebar's human `read`/`unread` state, so
  a person reading a task's output cannot appear in it at all. Its payload is
  `previousRuntimeState`, `runtimeState`, and `latestRunFinishedWithoutCompletion`
  (true when the session is `idle` or `exited` while its latest run is still
  `running` — a task parked without a stage verdict). It is unconditional — no
  waiting-prompt snippet, provider heuristic, or worktree timestamp gates it.
  The debounce is deliberately asymmetric, and
  `pipeline_item.runtime_event_baseline` holds the last value managers were
  told:
  - **Entering `busy` publishes immediately**, inside
    `update_pipeline_item_runtime_status` — the same write that changes
    `runtime_status`. An agent turn starting is an unambiguous positive daemon
    verdict, and damping it would silently drop every turn shorter than the
    window.
  - **Every non-busy value is damped.** It must hold for the fixed 10-second
    server debounce before it is published, so a busy→idle→busy blip inside
    that window emits nothing at all — returning to `busy` discards the pending
    candidate rather than publishing it. A change between two non-busy
    candidates restarts the same window and keeps the published baseline, so
    the eventual edge is measured from what managers were actually told.
  Runtime publication extends the existing `activity_event_debounce_loop` and
  `flush_debounced_activity_events` transaction; there is no second debounce
  worker or snapshot-diff detector.
- `task.runtime_settled` is the **deprecated** busy→non-busy subset of
  `task.runtime_changed`. It is appended in the same transaction as the event
  that supersedes it, so the two can never disagree, and it exists only so
  deployed watchers keyed on it keep working. New callers watch
  `task.runtime_changed`; `kanna-cli task watch` suppresses the alias as
  redundant with an event already in the batch.
- Fresh waits default to `includeCurrentActivity=true` and are level-triggered
  even with `from=now`; explicit `false` preserves edge-only reads:
  every scoped task whose current non-busy state has already survived that
  debounce is returned immediately as a synthetic `task.runtime_changed`
  response row without consuming or inventing a sequence number. It uses daemon
  runtime state only, never human read/unread activity. The durable
  sequence checkpoint remains independent, so restart cannot miss parked work
  and synthetic state cannot weaken the append-log ordering contract. Synthetic
  rows share the response limit with durable events. The opaque cursor also
  carries a stable task-id keyset checkpoint: passing it back while `hasMore`
  is true drains every scoped settled task once without an early row replay
  starving later rows. An aggregate cursor additionally records which machines
  still owe a native page, so it cannot report `hasMore: false` before every
  peer continuation has been consumed. Durable events appended during that
  drain remain ordered by, and advance, their own sequence checkpoint.
  Snapshot payloads name `reconciliationReason` (`idle_without_verdict`,
  `awaiting_input`, `session_exited`, or `settled`) and include the current
  stage, latest run, and `latestRunFinishedWithoutCompletion`. These are
  observations for reconciliation, not new completion outcomes. A continuation
  cursor acknowledges the initial scan; subsequent waits return edges rather
  than the same settled tasks forever. Closed tasks and tasks without an
  observed settled runtime are excluded. Human read state is never an ack.
- `task.awaiting_advance` is appended atomically when an un-killed daemon Exit
  ends a manual-transition main run without a stage verdict. It is useful
  terminal context, but managers use the level-triggered runtime-settled wait
  as the general primitive because an agent can stop at its composer without
  exiting.
- `task.activity_changed` is the provider-neutral settled display transition —
  the **human** read/unread dimension, not the manager one. A person opening a
  task in the desktop moves `unread` to `idle` and fires it, which is why a
  manager watches `task.runtime_changed` instead and drops this one with
  `excludeEventTypes`. It is unchanged for desktop and mobile consumers.
  Every activity direction (`working`, `idle`, or `unread`) is eligible for
  every provider; no waiting-prompt placeholder is required. The server waits
  for `activity_event_debounce_seconds` (20 seconds by default in
  `server.toml`) before appending it. An A→B→A flicker inside that window emits
  nothing, while each value that holds emits once. Its payload contains
  `previousActivity`, `activity`, the authoritative `runtimeState`, and
  `latestRunFinishedWithoutCompletion`; the last field identifies a settled
  idle task whose latest run remains without a stage-completion verdict, so a
  manager can advance it without a private polling/debounce loop. The
  aggregated `ks1.` feed adds `machineId` in the usual way.
- `task.blocked` and `task.unblocked` report the task's derived blocked state:
  `count_open_task_blockers > 0`, where a blocker resolves by closing or by
  parking at `pr` with a PR recorded. Because the predicate reads other tasks'
  rows, the edge is published both when a task's own `task_blocker` rows are
  rewritten and when a blocker resolves underneath it — `pipeline_item.blocked_event_baseline`
  is what turns the predicate into an edge, and the publishing write sites are
  exactly the ones the `task_blocker_resolution_revision` trigger already
  watches (`closed_at`, `stage`, `pr_url`) plus the blocker-table writes
  themselves. `payload.blocked` is the new state and `payload.blockerTaskIds`
  lists the still-unresolved blockers (empty on `task.unblocked`). Closed tasks
  publish nothing: nothing depends on the blocked state of finished work.
- `task.provider_quota_rejected` announces that a provider positively refused
  this task's turn because the allowance for the scope it named is spent. It is
  matched on the CLI's own rejection chrome at a measured version, or on the
  headless SDK's `rate_limit_info.status`, and is never inferred from a session
  going quiet. `payload.provider`, `model`, `effort`, `stage` and `stageRunId`
  identify the refused attempt; `payload.scope` is what the *provider* named
  (`null` means it named none, which is never "this provider is unavailable");
  `payload.source` is `pty` or `sdk`; `payload.ruleId`, `payload.matchedText`
  and `payload.cliVersion` are the evidence, so the claim can be checked rather
  than believed. `payload.recovery` is what was done —
  `fallback-started` with `payload.replacementRunId`, or a `parked-*` verdict.
  The event never finishes a run, advances a stage, or turns a failure into a
  success.
- `task.provider_quota_parked` is the one actionable state: nothing is left to
  try, so the task is waiting for a person. `payload.reason` is the recovery
  verdict, `payload.rejectedProviders` lists everything refused at this stage,
  and `payload.action` says what a human can do about it. Emitted once per
  refusal that parks — there is no retry loop behind it. See
  [`docs/specs/provider-quota-recovery.md`](specs/provider-quota-recovery.md).
- `task.input_delivered` announces a message delivered into a task's agent
  session from outside it. `payload.source` is the caller-declared author
  (`operator`, `manager`, `unspecified`); historical retained events may carry
  the retired `notify` source. `payload.runId` and `payload.stage` are what was
  live at delivery; `payload.preview` is a bounded prefix with `payload.truncated`
  saying whether it was cut. The event is only the announcement — the record is
  the `task_input` row, read through `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/inputs`. See
  [Delivered Task Inputs](#delivered-task-inputs).
- `task.raw_input_delivered` announces discrete terminal keys or explicit bytes
  written into a task's live PTY through
  `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/raw-input`. `payload.writes` lists every write's key
  name (`null` for explicit bytes), its exact bytes as hex, the declared composer
  class, and whether it was `written`, `uncertain`, or `not_written`;
  `payload.status` is the call's verdict, `payload.sessionPid` the PTY
  incarnation it was fenced to, and `payload.source` the caller-declared actor.
  It is a separate kind from `task.input_delivered` on purpose: there is no
  `task_input` row behind it, because a keystroke answering a menu is an action
  and not something somebody said. See
  [Raw terminal keys](#raw-terminal-keys).
- `task.teardown_failed` reports that detached best-effort workspace teardown
  failed to start or exceeded its hard deadline. Its payload contains
  `sessionId` and `error`; the same failure is written to the server log.
- `task.lifecycle_operation_retired` reports that a durable lifecycle
  operation intent — an accepted post, or a stage spawn crossing the daemon
  socket — was dropped without being applied because no server generation
  could ever reconcile it: its payload cannot be decoded, its kind is unknown,
  it names another task, it carries half a workspace, or its task has since
  been closed. That intent is also the task's pre-operation guard, so this
  event is what says the task was unblocked at the cost of the projection.
  `payload.reason` says why; `payload.operationId`, `payload.kind` and
  `payload.phase` identify what was retired. An operation that is merely
  *uncertain* is never retired — it stays durable until the daemon can answer
  for it.
  A retirement never destroys committed work. A stage spawn whose `Spawn`
  already crossed the daemon socket may have had its session created, so an
  agent may have run and committed in the workspace it forked; retiring it
  drops the stage move but keeps that workspace, and because the move never
  landed nothing else in the record names it. `payload.retainedBranch` and
  `payload.retainedWorktreePath` are then that branch and worktree, and the
  reason names the branch too, so an operator can find the work. They are
  `null` when nothing was kept — a pre-submission intent provably never
  started, so its fresh fork is removed as before.
- `task.transfer_finalizing` reports each step of a cross-machine transfer
  shutting the task's agent down (`payload.phase`: `wrap-up-sent`, `idle`,
  `quit-sent`, `exited`, `already-exited`, `degraded`). See
  [Source finalization](#source-finalization).

Every delivered event keeps event-time fields in the payload. In particular,
`payload.stage` is the stage in effect when the event was appended (older rows
that did not stamp it are reconstructed from preceding immutable task/run/stage
events), and run events keep their own `runId`, status, and result. Delivery-time
state is structurally separate under `payload.currentTask`: current title,
stage, activity, stage transition, and, for finished/awaiting events, latest-run
id/status plus a bounded summary snippet. A manager draining retained history
can therefore distinguish what happened from what it can do now. `machineId`
is present in the payload and at the aggregate row level.

Four scopes, in precedence order: `taskIds`, then `parentTaskId`, then
`repoId`, then `repoRemoteUrlHash`. `parentTaskId` exists because the other two do not cover a fan-out
that lost the ids it created — an id list dies with the context that held it,
and a repo scope hands the caller every other task's events to filter.
It is evaluated per read against `pipeline_item.parent_task_id`, so a task
created or adopted mid-watch is in scope at the next checkpoint. It covers
direct children only and excludes the parent's own events, which makes it
exactly the set `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}` reports as `childTaskIds`.

`excludeEventTypes` (comma-separated event type names) is the second filter
over whichever scope was chosen. It exists because a manager that must wake,
inspect and discard a `task.activity_changed` row has not been spared anything:
the point of the exclusion is that the wait does **not** return, so filtering
happens in SQL rather than after the read. Like `excludeTaskIds` it is not part
of any cursor, so a checkpoint issued under one list resumes under another, and
an unrecognized type name drops nothing. It is forwarded verbatim to every
machine leg of an aggregate wait, and it also suppresses the synthetic
`includeCurrentActivity` rows when the type they are reported as is excluded —
a synthetic row states the same fact as the durable event it is named after.
A repository-scoped manager watch is `excludeTaskIds=<own id>` plus
`excludeEventTypes=task.activity_changed`.

`excludeTaskIds` (comma-separated task ids or branch names) is a filter over
whichever scope was chosen, never a scope of its own. It drops those tasks'
durable events and their synthetic `includeCurrentActivity` rows on every
machine leg of an aggregate wait, and it is deliberately not part of any
cursor: a checkpoint issued under one exclusion list resumes under another,
and changing it never trips the scope-switch rejection below. Excluded rows are
consumed by the checkpoint, not deferred — a later call that drops the
exclusion does not replay them. An id that matches no task excludes nothing.
It exists because the repository scope includes the caller: a manager running
`kanna-cli task watch --repo-id` inside its own task session was woken by its
own `task.runtime_settled` edge at the end of every turn, forever. The server
has no notion of "self", so the exclusion is client policy applied once in
`kanna-tool-catalog` (`args_with_self_exclusion`) and shared by `kanna-mcp`,
`kanna-cli tool call`, and the typed `kanna-cli task watch` / `task
wait-events` commands: a repository-scoped wait issued with `KANNA_TASK_ID`
set adds the caller's own id to `exclude_task_ids` unless `include_self` /
`--include-self` is given. Explicit `taskIds` and `parentTaskId` scopes are
taken literally — the former is already explicit and the latter excludes the
parent structurally.

`eventTypes` (comma-separated event type names) is the allow-list complement
of `excludeEventTypes`, and the third filter over the chosen scope. It exists
because the exclusion list is the wrong shape for the common manager: one that
acts on `run.finished`, `task.pr_created`, `task.revision_requested`,
`task.merge_signaled`, `task.input_delivered`, `task.created` and
`task.closed` had to enumerate every noisy type instead, and silently started
waking on every type added afterwards. Empty means every type. An explicit
`excludeEventTypes` entry still wins, so naming both narrows rather than
contradicts; a name matching no event type simply matches nothing. Like the
two exclusion lists it is filtered in SQL, is not part of any cursor, and
consumes what it drops rather than deferring it — a watcher that widens the
list later does not get the dropped rows replayed. It is forwarded verbatim to
every machine leg of an aggregate wait, and an allow-list that does not name
`task.runtime_changed` suppresses the synthetic `includeCurrentActivity` rows
with it.

`excludeOwn` breaks the loop where an orchestrator sends input to a task and
then waits on it: the delivery's own `task.input_delivered` row ends the very
next wait, before the agent it spoke to has done anything, and the manager
wakes again on each status flip that follows. It drops `task.input_delivered`
and `task.raw_input_delivered` rows whose `payload.source` is `manager` —
raw terminal writes count as own for the same reason ordinary ones do. The
match is positive and exactly as wide as the delivering caller's own
declaration. **An operator delivery is never dropped**, because a human
intervening in a watched task is precisely what a manager must see, and a
delivery whose caller declared nothing is indistinguishable from that human,
so it is not dropped either — a manager that wants the suppression declares
`source: "manager"` on `kanna_send_task_input`, which is what the input record
asks of it anyway. The label is as far as the record goes: `task_input` records
*that* a manager spoke, not *which* one, so `excludeOwn` also drops a peer
manager's delivery into a task this one is watching. That is the honest reading
of the data — inventing an identity the row does not carry would be worse — and
a manager that must see its peers' deliveries passes `excludeOwn=false` and
filters them itself, or reads them with `kanna_task_inputs`, which is the
durable record and is unaffected. Also a filter, never part of the cursor. Its default is
client policy, not a server default: `args_with_self_exclusion` in
`kanna-tool-catalog` sets it for a call made from inside a task session
(`KANNA_TASK_ID`), on every scope rather than only the repository one, because
the loop it breaks happens under an explicit `taskIds` watch. The typed
`kanna-cli task wait-events` applies the same rule; a direct HTTP caller that
omits it keeps the unfiltered feed.

### Batching a task-event wait

Three parameters shape *when* one wait returns. None of them changes *what* it
eventually returns: the cursor contract is unchanged, so a batched boundary
delivers every event exactly once, in sequence order, and a batch that is cut
short by its timeout still acknowledges what it collected.

- `minEvents` (default 1) holds the wait until that many filtered events have
  accumulated. It is capped at `limit`, since a response cannot carry more than
  a page — otherwise asking for more than a page would turn every wait into a
  timeout.
- `debounceMs` (default 0, ceiling 60s) keeps collecting for that long after
  the **first** event of the batch, so a burst — a run finishing, its post
  starting, a stage change, a PR created — comes back as one response. The
  window is opened once and never restarted by later events, so a steady stream
  cannot defer a response indefinitely.
- `minIntervalMs` (default 0, ceiling 60s) floors how long one call takes
  before it returns events, measured from the start of the call rather than
  from an event. It is the rate limit for a caller that loops: however fast
  events arrive, it wakes at most once per interval. There is no per-caller
  server state behind it and deliberately so — a wait has no authenticated
  caller, and the loop's own cadence is what the floor governs.

They compose: the wait returns once it holds `minEvents` and every hold window
has closed. Two things override all three, because waiting cannot improve
them — `hasMore`, and a full page. Both mean the caller must call again
immediately anyway. And the timeout overrides them in the other direction: an
elapsed window returns whatever accumulated, `waitOutcome: "timeout"` with a
possibly non-empty `events` array, rather than holding events back for a batch
the caller never asked to wait longer for.

`minEvents` and `debounceMs` compose with the cross-machine fan-out the way the
timeout does — enforced by the machine serving the wait, over every leg's
events together. They are deliberately *not* forwarded to the legs: a
per-machine minimum would hold one machine's events back while the fan-out
already had enough of them, and a per-machine debounce would stack on the one
applied at the top. A leg that has already answered is simply re-armed while
the batch is still filling, which is how a burst split across machines comes
back as one response. `kanna-mcp`'s own `km1` client fan-in applies the same
rule, from the same `kanna_tool_catalog::task_event_batch_is_complete`, so
`minEvents` counts the same events on every path. The filters are the opposite
case and *are* forwarded verbatim, because a leg must not return rows the
caller asked to drop.

The point of all of this is the cost of watching. A singleton manager that
watched a repository in 100-second legs made ~4,700 requests in two days —
every leg returned in seconds because runtime flicker counts as an event, and
79% of that session's token spend was this one surface. `minEvents`,
`debounceMs`, `eventTypes`, `minIntervalMs` and `excludeOwn` move that cost
into the server. The complement for continuous management remains
`kanna_subscribe_events`, whose durable mailbox owns observation; this is the
cheap version for plain polling.

A cursor is bound to its scope. Resuming a `repoId` cursor with `taskIds` or
`parentTaskId` (or vice versa) is rejected with HTTP 400 `cursor belongs to a
different task-event scope`; a watcher that changes scope must start at the
live tail (`from=now`) and cannot carry its checkpoint across. With
`excludeTaskIds` there is no reason for a manager to leave the repository
scope to avoid itself.

Reparenting uses read-checkpoint semantics. Every response advances one global
sequence after evaluating the membership that exists for that read. Moving a
child away and back never rewinds the sequence or replays acknowledged events;
an event after the checkpoint is eligible if the child is back under the parent
at the next read. An event that was outside the scope when an intervening empty
read advanced past it stays ineligible after the child returns. Omitting the
cursor is the explicit way to request retained history for current membership.
The hot query always starts with the indexable `task_event.seq > ?` range and
uses `idx_pipeline_item_parent_created_id` for membership, so an empty long poll
advances past unrelated rows instead of rescanning retained history on every
recheck.

## Delivered Task Inputs

`POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/input` writes to a PTY. Terminal bytes are not a
record: the message is visible in that live terminal and nowhere else, so every
consumer that reasons from durable state — a review stage running in a forked
worktree with a fresh session, a dispatcher, a post-hoc audit — was structurally
blind to it, and could "prove" from the record that an owner directive it was
told about had never been issued. That happened on 2026-08-19: a round-2 review
agent read the stage prompts, post prompts, and revision feedback, concluded
there had been "no owner send-input at any point", and instructed the
implementer to revert an owner's mid-task design directive.

Every delivery the daemon **accepts** is therefore appended to `task_input`:
the full message text, `delivered_at`, the `stage` the task was on, the
`stage_run` that was running at the time (null when none was), and a `source`.
The row is the record; `task.input_delivered` is only its announcement.

Raw terminal keys are deliberately outside this table. `POST
/v1/tasks/{task_id}/raw-input` writes an arrow or an Escape, not a sentence, and
a row here would let a reviewer read terminal control bytes as owner speech —
the mirror of the 2026-08-19 failure above rather than a fix for it. Those calls
are announced as `task.raw_input_delivered` instead; see
[Raw terminal keys](#raw-terminal-keys). So an empty `kanna_task_inputs` means
no message was delivered, and says nothing either way about whether a menu was
answered.

- **Sources.** `operator` and `manager` are **declared by the caller and not
  verified**: the endpoint cannot tell a human typing on mobile from an
  orchestrating agent's MCP call, and a distinction it cannot observe is better
  admitted than invented. A caller may declare `operator` or `manager`;
  declaring `notify` is a 400. Omitting the field records `unspecified`, which
  is what desktop, mobile, and CLI deliveries do. Historical rows may carry the
  retired server-assigned `notify` source, but no new delivery uses it. What
  every record proves regardless of label is that text entered the session from
  outside it, at a recorded time, with the recorded content.
- **Completion is not task input.** The server does not inject completion
  messages into another task's PTY or append completion rows to `task_input`.
  Managers observe completion through `kanna_wait_events` for fan-out or
  `kanna_wait_task` for a single task, backed by durable run and task events.
- **A row is written after the daemon answers.** The server records the
  delivery once the daemon has confirmed the bytes reached the PTY, and not
  before. There is no queue table and no pending state: nothing is ever
  retained, so there is nothing to reconcile across a restart. Rows that used
  to sit `queued` against an empty composer for hours — bookkeeping for a hold
  that had already resolved — no longer exist.
- **Uncertain deliveries are not recorded.** A `delivery_uncertain` response
  means the bytes may or may not have reached the PTY; a row asserting the agent
  was told something it may never have heard is a worse record than a missing
  one, and that path already tells its caller not to retry blindly.
- **Recording never fails a delivery.** By the time the row is written the bytes
  are queued in the PTY, so a DB failure is logged and the request still
  succeeds — answering with an error would invite a retry that duplicates
  terminal input.
- **Full text, no truncation.** Rows cascade with the task and are as short-lived
  as it is. Only the event payload's `preview` is bounded (200 characters, with
  `truncated`), because the event feed is a 14-day wake-up channel.
- **Attachments are the delivered text.** An input with a photo records the
  composed message, which names the stored file's absolute path — see
  [Image attachments](#image-attachments). There is no separate attachment
  field to read, and no record is written for an attachment whose message never
  reached the session.
- **Scope.** This covers `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/input`. Stage prompts, post
  prompts, and revision feedback
  are already durable on `stage_run` and are not duplicated here; blocker
  resolution instructions and transfer wrap-up messages are server-generated
  session control and are likewise not recorded. An empty list therefore means
  "nothing was sent through the input surface", not "nothing was ever said to
  this task".

`GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/inputs?tail=N` returns the most recent `N` records
(default 100, clamped to 500) oldest first, plus `total` — so a tailed window is
visible rather than silent. `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}` reports
`deliveredInputCount` so a consumer reading only task detail cannot conclude
from it that nothing was ever sent. The review and qa-dispatcher agent
definitions require reading this surface before making any claim about what was
or was not instructed.

## The Composer Is Not Session Output

A CLI's composer line — the `❯` a Claude session sits at, the `›` Codex draws —
is where somebody is *about* to speak. It is not something the session said,
and the Claude CLI fills it with a tab-to-accept suggestion whenever it goes
idle. Presented as undifferentiated content it reads exactly like a directive:
"run it on my phone so i can see it" was read as one by a task manager and
stalled a task for a day.

So the composer is reported as its own labelled field and is excluded from
every surface that means "what the session said":

- The ordinary human/UI `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}` view reports
  `composer: { text?, attestation }`. `attestation` is `typed` (keystrokes
  reached that composer since its last producer-declared submission boundary,
  so `text` may be a human's unsent line), `not-typed` (the daemon watched the
  session and counted none, so `text` is provably the provider's own chrome or
  suggestion), or `unknown` (nothing can be proven about that composer — a
  session inherited from before attestation, or from a predecessor daemon that
  handed over no ledger). The field is **absent** until a session reports one,
  which is a different answer from `unknown`.
- **`typed` is the ledger's verdict, and the rendered frame can overturn it
  towards `not-typed`.** A composer whose every cell is painted faint with the
  cursor still at its start is the provider's own suggestion, whatever the
  ledger counted earlier; that frame resolves the session to `not-typed`. It
  never goes the other way — no frame has ever been allowed to assert that
  somebody typed something.
- **Attestation decides what may be *read*, never whether a message is
  delivered.** A logical message goes out over any composer, attested or not.
  What `unknown` costs is that nothing on that line may be treated as an
  instruction — which is the whole point of the ledger.
- `waitingPromptSnippet` (and the deprecated input-only `snippet` alias) never
  contains composer-line text. The
  daemon's snippet extraction cuts at the composer's *position*, not by a
  per-line rule, because a composer long enough to wrap leaves continuation
  rows carrying no prompt glyph.
- The ordinary human/UI `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/logs` view keeps the composer line in the rendered tail
  but labels it — `[composer (not-typed), not session output: …]` — because a
  reader deserves to know a composer is there without being able to mistake it
  for transcript.
- Agent tools request `agentView=true`. In that view, task detail omits the
  entire composer field unless attestation is `typed`, and logs remove the
  composer row plus wrapped continuation/hint rows unless it is typed. A typed
  row remains as `[composer draft (typed), not session output: …]`. The bundled
  MCP catalog and CLI read/wait/log paths always select this view, so provider
  suggestions never reach an agent as content.

The values come from the daemon, which is the only thing that knows what was
typed: it publishes `ComposerChanged` on the composer's own edges (a suggestion
appearing, a human starting to type, a boundary clearing the ledger) and
carries the same two fields on `SessionInfo`, so the watcher reconciles them
from `List` against every daemon generation. Raw PTY transcripts are unchanged;
this is a rule about derived surfaces.

The broader meaning and future of `waitingPromptSnippet` is deliberately out of
scope here and tracked by issue #1213. Event delivery never gates on snippet
presence; beyond excluding composer rows, its existing semantics are unchanged.

The ledger counts only bytes that can *create* composer content, so a session
someone only navigated, scrolled or clicked in stays `not-typed`. It decides
what may be read from a composer, and nothing else: a delivered message is
written over any composer, whatever the ledger says. See
`crates/daemon/SPEC.md`.

## Task Parentage

`pipeline_item.parent_task_id` is read from both ends: `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}`
returns `parentTaskId` upward and `childTaskIds` downward. `childTaskIds` lists
direct children oldest first and **includes closed ones** — parentage is
durable, and a finished child is exactly what a fan-out orchestrator reconciles,
so an empty list means "nothing was dispatched" rather than "everything already
finished". This is deliberately unlike `GET /v1/tasks/search` and
`GET /v1/repos/{repo_id}/tasks`, which list open tasks only.

`GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/children` is the richer join surface for that same
parentage edge. It returns direct children only, includes closed children, and
orders them oldest first. Each item contains `id`, optional `workflowName`,
optional `agent`, `createdAt`, optional `closedAt`, and optional `latestRun`
(`stage`, `kind`, `trigger`, `status`, `summary`, and `finishedAt`). `trigger`
is `auto`, `operator`, `manager`, or `unspecified` and answers how the run's
stage was entered; existing pre-migration rows are `unspecified`. The workflow
identity and latest run let a fan-out owner reconstruct durable child verdicts
after notifications, context compaction, or a fresh agent session; a closed
child remains part of that history because closure is lifecycle cleanup, not
parentage or verdict deletion. This route is scoped reconstruction for one
parent's fan-out/join. It is not a general endpoint for listing closed tasks;
repository task listing and search keep their existing open-task semantics.

## Task State: Runtime and Read Are Two Dimensions

A task carries two orthogonal facts, and conflating them is what made a busy
agent indistinguishable from a finished one:

| Dimension | Field | Values | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime — what the agent process is doing | `runtimeState` | `busy`, `waiting`, `idle`, `exited`, or absent | the daemon's terminal-state detection, plus `exited` written by the server when a session ends |
| Read — whether a human has seen the latest output | `readState` | `read`, `unread` | the operator: selection, `mark-read`, and the writes that flag new output |

`GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}` and the task-listing routes report both, alongside
the pre-existing `activity`.

`activity` (`working` \| `idle` \| `unread`) is **kept, unchanged in meaning**:
it is the desktop's derived display value, blending both dimensions, and every
existing consumer — the sidebar, mobile, the event feed, external supervisors —
keeps reading exactly what it read before. What changed is that the two
dimensions it blends are now also reported on their own, because `activity`
cannot answer either question by itself:

- A task working inside a long tool or MCP call, whose latest output nobody has
  read, carries `activity: "unread"` — the same value a finished task carries.
  `runtimeState: "busy"` is what separates them, and it is `busy` for the whole
  call: Claude's `esc to interrupt` chrome stays on screen while an MCP request
  is outstanding.
- A run wedged on a provider error settles to `activity: "idle"` with a running
  `stage_run`, which reads no differently from a task thinking between turns.
  `runtimeState` distinguishes `idle` (parked at its composer) from `exited`
  (the session is gone).

Which dimension each consumer reads:

- **Waits** (`kanna_wait_task`, `kanna-cli task wait`) read terminations only —
  `closedAt`, a terminal `stage_run`, or `runtimeState: "exited"`. `unread` used
  to resolve `until: finished`, which meant an unread working task could satisfy
  a wait for it to finish.

  Know what that costs. Three things record a termination: the task closes, its
  agent records a verdict (`kanna_complete_stage`, or any write that finishes
  the run), or its **process exits**. A PTY agent that finishes its turn and
  parks at its composer without recording a verdict does none of them — its
  daemon session survives, since sessions die only at a stage transition, a
  rerun, or a close — so it reports `runtimeState: "idle"` with a `running`
  `latestRun`, and `until: "finished"` does not resolve for it. `unread` used to
  resolve that case, at the cost of also resolving on every busy task nobody had
  read.

  The default `until: "reconcile"` returns this already-settled task instead.
  Task detail's `runtimeSettled` uses the same observed non-busy baseline and
  completed debounce as the synthetic feed scan, never human read state or
  absence of output. It also resolves for recorded termination. Explicit
  `until: "finished"` retains the contract above; `until: "closed"` requires
  closure. A resolved reconciliation wait asks the caller to inspect work;
  it does not create a verdict, advance a stage, or claim a turn is complete.
- **Supervisors and orchestrators** read `runtimeState` to decide whether a task
  is alive. A quiet-task alarm keyed on `activity` fires on tasks whose agents
  are demonstrably running.
- **The desktop sidebar and mobile** read `activity`: the operator's view is
  exactly the blend, and it is unchanged.

`runtimeState` is stored on `pipeline_item.runtime_status`. `exited` is written
when a task's daemon session exits without a replacement — the same signal that
finalizes the run, so it never fires
for the orchestrated kills behind a stage swap, rerun, or close. Starting a new
running `stage_run` clears a stale `exited` back to absent, so a fresh session
is never reported as already gone.

## Provider Quota Rejection

A CLI that refuses a turn for a spent allowance prints its refusal and parks at
its composer. The session is alive, the run is `running`, and both `activity`
and `runtimeState` report a perfectly healthy idle task — which is exactly why a
day of exhausted quota once read as an ordinary dead session and a rerun
re-spawned the same exhausted provider.

The server therefore records the refusal as its own durable fact and, where the
contract allows it, walks the stage's ordered candidate list once:

- The daemon classifies the refusal positively (measured PTY chrome, or the
  SDK's own `rate_limit_info.status == "rejected"`) and broadcasts
  `ProviderNotice`. It is a notice, not a status: the session keeps whatever
  the grid proves about it.
- `task_provider_rejection` holds one row per `(stage_run, provider, stated
  scope)`. That uniqueness de-duplicates a replayed or re-adopted announcement,
  so one refusal is one observation and one attempt.
- Recovery takes the same single-flight task-mutation guard a close, rerun or
  stage change takes, closes the refused run as `failed` with the provider's own
  sentence *before* spawning anything, and starts the next candidate in the same
  task, stage, workspace and session with that candidate's own model and effort.
  The workspace is never reset, forked or recreated.
- An explicit single-provider override is binding, and a refusal that arrives
  after the workspace changed parks instead of replacing. Every parked verdict
  is one state with an `action` sentence and no retry loop.
- `kanna_get_task` reports `providerRejection` for the stage the task currently
  occupies, including every provider refused there. `rerun_stage` re-resolves
  around that set. `resume` cannot: it reopens the recorded provider's *own*
  conversation, and re-pointing that would be a fresh session wearing a
  resume's name. A past refusal does not refuse it — reopening once the
  allowance has reset is exactly what the `parked-work-observed` action tells
  the operator to do. Use `kanna_rerun_stage` when the stage's other candidates
  should be considered.

Full contract: [`docs/specs/provider-quota-recovery.md`](specs/provider-quota-recovery.md).

## Activity Confirmation in `kanna-mcp`

`pipeline_item.activity` is written from the daemon's rendered-terminal
verdict. ANSI control bytes are interpreted before provider patterns are
matched, and a DEC synchronized-output redraw is not classified until the
provider closes the frame. Intermediate spinner, status-line, and update-banner
paint therefore cannot publish a false status or consume the classifier's
per-session throttle slot. The daemon's periodic settled-frame check is
independent of output-triggered throttling, so chrome repaints cannot starve
convergence to an idle composer. Within a complete frame the provider matcher
is stateless: the matching rule still decides Busy from a marker the provider
drew, without inventing a quiet-time heuristic. Which patterns are matched is
selected by the CLI version the session is running, from the declarative rule
set in `crates/daemon/src/detection/rules.json` — see
`docs/specs/agent-status-detection-rules.md`.

`kanna-mcp` smooths that at the point of consumption, asymmetrically:

- A response with nothing stopped-looking in it is returned as-is. Reporting
  busy promptly is never the misread being guarded against.
- A stopped-looking response is re-read once after `ACTIVITY_CONFIRM_DELAY`
  (1s, two daemon detection windows), and the fresher response is what the
  caller sees.
- The confirmation reports whatever it finds and never rewrites one activity
  value into another, so the three-way vocabulary is unchanged and `unread`
  keeps meaning "output nobody has read yet" rather than "stopped" — a busy
  agent can carry `unread`.
- A closed task is exempt: closure is a database fact, not a frame
  classification.
- **A failed confirmation is not a confirmation.** If the re-read fails, the
  tool call fails with a message saying the stop went unconfirmed. Returning the
  unconfirmed first sample instead would surface the exact false stop this
  exists to suppress, and `kanna_wait_task` would resolve on it.
- It smooths Busy/Idle only. `waiting` stays a positive match on prompt chrome
  in the daemon; nothing here turns quiet into blocked.

Which tools pay, and how much — the cost is always one extra `GET` of the same
route plus 1s, never one request per task:

| Tool | When the confirmation fires |
|---|---|
| `kanna_get_task` | Only when that task already looked stopped. |
| `kanna_wait_task` | Never. Its predicate reads recorded terminations, not `activity`, so there is no frame classification to confirm. |
| `kanna_list_recent_tasks`, `kanna_search_tasks`, `kanna_list_repo_tasks` | Whenever **any** task in the response looks stopped. For a repo listing that is the common case, so budget these at roughly +1s per call regardless of how many tasks come back. |

The current task row is not debounced: it always stores the daemon's latest
complete-frame verdict. `task.activity_changed` events use the server debounce
described above, delaying rather than dropping a candidate transition until it
holds. `kanna-cli` does not perform the MCP confirmation read — it is the shell
interface, where a human reads the current value in context.

## Dynamic Workflow Changes

`POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/actions/set-workflow` and
`kanna_set_task_workflow` replace an open task's current workflow name and
`pipeline_def` snapshot atomically. Resolution and serialization use the same
pinning path as task creation, including repo overrides, legacy snapshot
normalization, and retired built-in aliases (`default` resolves to
`no-review` unless the repo still defines `default.json`).

Stage mapping is deliberately strict: the new definition must contain a stage
whose name exactly matches the task's current stage. The task stays at that
stage. If it is absent, the request returns `409 Conflict`, names the
incompatible stage and workflow, and changes nothing. Kanna does not guess a
nearest stage because that could silently skip or repeat work.

A running `stage_run`, terminal session, branch, and worktree are not replaced
or killed. The live run finishes normally, and the new snapshot governs its
next transition. `revision_rounds` also remains unchanged; switching to a
higher `revision_limit` can therefore make more rounds available, while
switching to an equal or lower limit cannot reset spent rounds. A successful
change emits `task.workflow_changed` with the old and new names, current stage,
spent rounds, and new limit.

The companion inline surface, `kanna_replace_task_workflow` / CLI `task
replace-workflow`, edits the pinned definition while preserving the selected
workflow name. It shares the atomic DB pin-write path and accepts
`workflowDefinition`, an unchanged `expectedDefinition` from task detail, and
caller-declared `source`. Stale edits return 409. The server validates the
bundled workflow schema, provider selectors, agent/environment resolution, and
retention of current/historical stage names, roles, post owners and relative
order before writing. New submissions use current syntax; old snapshots are
compiled through the existing legacy-post loader for compatibility checks.

An execution edit (agent, provider candidates, prompt, effective environment)
supersedes that stage's old runs as templates for its next spawn. Rerun,
recovery and revision then resolve the new definition and start a fresh
conversation; unchanged stages retain their provider stamps. An edited stage
that never spawned also releases its creation-request override. Live sessions
and their stamped completion policies remain in force. Future transitions use
the new snapshot as usual. This edits a task definition without adding another
provider-override layer or changing config precedence.

`task.workflow_changed` carries full before/after definitions, declared source,
operation, changed execution stages, and superseded run IDs, with task ID and
time in the event envelope. These audit/execution records survive ordinary
14-day feed pruning. See [Runtime workflow replacement](specs/runtime-workflow-replacement.md)
for limits, lifecycle semantics and the incident E2E.

## Sticky Workflow Selection

`GET /v1/repos/{repo_id}/recent-workflows` backs the New Task modal's default
workflow: a repo's most recently used workflow outranks the one its
`.kanna/config.json` configures. The caller keeps the first returned name its
repo still offers and otherwise falls back to the configured default, so a
renamed or deleted workflow degrades instead of sticking.

It is a projection of the durable `pipeline_item.initial_pipeline` values, not
a mutable preference. That column captures the successfully created task's
choice and is intentionally not changed by dynamic re-pipelining:

- **No `closed_at` filter.** `db::snapshot` excludes closed tasks, so a create
  whose response was lost and whose task then closed — possibly from another
  window — would be invisible to a snapshot-based answer. The row is what
  matters, and the row survives the close.
- **No recovery record to reconcile or clear.** A create either commits its task
  row or it does not; there is no second write that can fail on its own and lose
  the choice, and nothing to publish after the fact.
- **Every writer feeds it, every reader agrees.** Any path that creates a task —
  desktop, LAN/mobile, relay — updates it without being instrumented, and all
  windows and restarts read the same rows.
- **Child tasks are excluded** (`parent_task_id IS NULL`). A specialty review a
  review stage dispatched is not a workflow the operator picked.

## Task Completion Observation

Task completion is observed through the existing MCP wait surfaces:
`kanna_wait_events` for fan-out and `kanna_wait_task` for one task. The durable
facts are the terminating `stage_run`, its `run.finished` event, `task.closed`
when applicable, and task detail. Kanna does not inject completion text into a
manager task's PTY; that input channel is reserved for actual operator and
manager speech.

The structured status vocabulary remains closed — three words, matched exactly:

- `success` — the task ended cleanly: it advanced past its final workflow stage,
  or its session ended with no failing verdict recorded against it.
- `failure` — its terminating `stage_run` reported failure, or the agent process
  itself died (non-zero exit). A verdict of failure wins even when the PTY then
  exits 0, because an agent that reports failure and quits still failed.
- `closed` — the task was closed before finishing its workflow (sidebar ⇧⌘⌫ or
  `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/actions/close`). No verdict was ever reached; this is
  not a failure and must not be diagnosed as one.

Daemon `Exit` finalizes activity/runtime state and any running `stage_run` in
the same server-side path regardless of whether a desktop event bridge is
open. An interrupted run's structured result keeps `success` or `failure` as
appropriate; a direct close is `closed`, while a normal workflow finish keeps
the successful terminating run. The account-wide event feed preserves these
facts across machines.

The legacy SQLite columns `pipeline_item.notify_task_id` and `notified_at`
remain readable for database/snapshot compatibility but are inert. The
creation field is deprecated and rejected when non-null, the set-notify route
and `kanna_set_task_notify` tool have been removed, and existing values are
never claimed. Historical `task_input` rows and `task.input_delivered` events
whose source is `notify` remain part of the audit record; no new ones are
written.

## Merge Handoff

The generic repo-agent signal endpoint, task-input API, desktop task terminal,
KSP/relay steering, and the approve-post helper all deliver ordinary requests
to the `merge` singleton. The resolved repo agent definition independently
accepts or declines each request under the repository's checked-in policy.
Kanna does not interpret review history, bind a saved PR candidate, police
branch names, or attach an approval attestation.

The approve-post helper resolves the task's repository and sends this compact
ordinary request through the same singleton signal path:

```text
MERGE <head> -> <base> [TASK <task-id>] [PR <url>]: <summary>
```

**The handoff is the engine's obligation, not the post agent's memory.** A post
is injected into whatever agent session its stage left running, so a pr agent
that was still mid-work when the approve post arrived reads the post prompt as
its next instruction — it creates the PR, reports that, and never signals. That
happened to four consecutive review-bearing tasks on 2026-08-07, each of which
then closed leaving an open PR the merge master had never heard of.

So delivery is recorded, not assumed. `signal-merge-handoff` stamps
`pipeline_item.merge_signaled_at` *after* the request reaches the merge agent
and appends `task.merge_signaled` (`payload.source`: `agent`). Before closing a
task past a final stage whose pinned workflow declares the merge-signaling
`approve` post, the engine checks that stamp and, if the task still owes a
request, composes and delivers the identical line itself from the recorded
`pr_url` (`payload.source`: `engine`). The head branch comes from the
workspace's live branch, since the pr agent renames what it pushes; the target
is the repo's default branch. Both are hints — the merge agent resolves the
live PR and applies the repository's policy, exactly as for an agent-sent
request. Kanna still attests nothing.

If such a stage finishes with no `pr_url` at all there is nothing to hand off,
which means the approve post reported success without producing the PR it
exists to approve. The engine refuses the close: the task stays open at its
final stage, goes `unread`, and emits `task.merge_handoff_missing`. A watcher
must read that as a failed approval, never as a finished workflow.

A workflow whose final stage declares no `approve` post promised no merge side
effect, and nothing is enforced on its behalf.

New merge sessions accept ordinary terminal input. On startup and after daemon
replacement, kanna-server clears the retired native-terminal-only
classification from inherited PTYs so older merge singletons also use the
normal input path. This compatibility cleanup is unrelated to daemon process
handoff and descriptor transfer, which continue to preserve PTY sessions
across desktop/server/daemon restarts and upgrades.

The native desktop still uses a private Unix control socket for desktop
adoption. Peer eligibility is checked before reading a request, and the initial
request frame has a fixed deadline so idle or unauthorized local connections
cannot retain server tasks and descriptors indefinitely.

Stage completion resolves an omitted `runId` to the task's sole running run,
including a post injected into an existing agent session. This applies to
spawned and legacy runs alike. Multiple running runs require an explicit id;
the 409 response lists the candidate ids. An explicit id must match the
resolved run; a stale-id error names both the supplied and current ids.
With no running run, the latest run retains late-verdict recovery and replay
behavior. Request-revision uses the same resolution and still requires an
agent's resolved live run to be a main run; merge handoff is task-scoped and
has no run-id binding.

MCP and both CLI completion paths always send `completionAttemptKey`, even
without run context. Context-less attempts are stored durably in
`contextless_completion_attempt`, keyed by `(task_id, attempt_key)` with the
original `run_id` and verdict JSON. The binding and run verdict commit in one
transaction. Lookup precedes running-run resolution: an identical retry returns
the original acknowledgement without finishing or advancing another run, even
after a server restart. A key reused with a different verdict returns 409.
Explicit run-bound attempts retain the lineage rules below. Since adapter keys
are deterministic verdict bodies, identical context-less prose means the same
attempt for that task; submitting it for a later run requires explicit run
context. This adds migration 062, without changing the HTTP/tool schema.

Adapters prefer the run identity in the spawned agent's protected environment
and its server-owned completion-context file, reread on each call. A successor
gets a distinct file, so preparing it never publishes an identity to the live
predecessor. Continued posts rebind only the inherited process's file, under a
cross-process lock, while retaining a bounded mapping from verdict attempt keys
to their original runs. MCP and CLI adapters consult that mapping. At startup,
the server compiles the prior run-scoped format from its immutable filename and
the original run's durable exact result; request handling repeats that
server-owned check so a surviving old unlocked adapter cannot overwrite the
protection. A timed-out run-bound verdict therefore retries its original run
and can neither complete the post nor restore stale context. Failed preparation,
replacement, close, and startup prune stale or orphaned context artifacts. The
server rejects a mismatched current run but treats an identical retry of an
already-finished run as idempotent even after a post or replacement starts. New
clients also tolerate old task-detail responses that lack `latestRun.id`.
The `completion_bound` bit still records spawn provenance; it no longer makes
an omitted run id an error when durable running state is unambiguous.

## Mobile Task Worktree Browser

The mobile file browser exists only in task context and resolves its root from
the task's current durable worktree record. It does not browse a repository's
main checkout and exposes no repo-level browse route. A stage advance therefore
makes subsequent requests follow the task into its newly recorded worktree.

`GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/browse` lists one bounded directory page (`offset`,
`limit`, `filter`, `showAllFiles`).
`GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/browse/content` reads one bounded line range
(`startLine`, `lineCount`, `metadataOnly`); metadata ranges contain line lengths
for skeleton sizing, while content ranges contain text for the same viewport.
The server caps directory pages, line counts, and returned text bytes regardless
of caller values. Binary files are identified without returning their contents.

Both routes require either a paired LAN device or an authenticated relay
invoke. Relay invokes remain behind `remote_task_control`; LAN access is free.
The relay's byte odometer attributes browse invokes and responses to the
dedicated `fileBrowse` class. Every requested root and target is canonicalized,
and a target whose resolved path leaves the worktree root is rejected, including
symlink escapes. The surface is read-only: there are no write, delete, download,
git, or search-in-files operations.

## A Task Owns Several Terminals

A task used to have exactly one PTY, and its id *was* that session's id, so
"the task", "the task's session" and "the task's terminal" were one noun. The
repo's startup commands ran inside the agent's own login shell — `pnpm install`
and the agent's first turn sharing one scrollback — and a stage transition
respawned the same session id over the top of it, which is why reading a stage
boundary needed the outgoing terminal's history copied into its replacement.

A launch now owns a **pair**. The repo's setup runs first, visibly, in a plain
`setup` terminal of its own; when that shell exits cleanly the server starts the
agent in the `agent` session. Every launch — task creation, a stage advance, a
rerun — opens its own setup terminal, so a stage boundary is a terminal
boundary and a stage's startup output is still there to read after the stage has
moved on. Teardown of a departing workspace is a `teardown` terminal by the same
rule; it used to run detached with nowhere to print at all.

`terminal_session` carries what each one is: `role` (`setup` / `agent` /
`teardown` / `legacy_agent`), the `stage` and launch `attempt` it belongs to,
whether it is still `live`, and the status a finished one exited with.
`GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/terminals` (`kanna_list_task_terminals`) is how a
client asks which terminals a task has — and whether each one's final frame was
archived — rather than deriving one from its id, and
`POST /v1/desktop/views/open-terminal` (`kanna_open_terminal`) opens one as a
tab — a view, never a spawn.

Three invariants hold this together:

- **Only the agent terminal answers to the task id.** Task logs, delivered
  input, raw keys, completion, the composer and waiting-prompt surfaces all
  resolve a task to its agent session, and `terminal_session.role` is what makes
  that resolution exact rather than a guess at a label. A `setup` session's
  `Exit` is that shell finishing its own job, never an agent completing:
  the watcher checks the role before running the agent-facing completion path,
  and a session id with no record at all is treated as the agent, so a lookup
  failure can never silently stop a real completion from being observed.
- **A plain terminal is spawned without a provider.** `agent_provider: None`
  resolves no detection rules, so a setup script that prints something shaped
  like CLI chrome cannot be read as an agent waiting for an answer. Teardown was
  previously spawned as Claude and is now plain for the same reason.
- **What setup exports still reaches the agent.** The single shell gave that
  away for free; splitting it means carrying it deliberately. The setup shell's
  last successful step is the bundled `kanna-cli setup-receipt`, which writes
  that shell's environment and working directory to a private, launch-scoped
  file under the daemon directory. The server merges it into the agent's spawn
  environment — dropping only the shell's own bookkeeping — resolves the
  provider executable against the PATH setup left behind, and deletes the
  receipt. It is a *readiness* receipt: it says setup finished and what it left
  behind, and nothing about the task's outcome passes through it. Setup that
  fails, times out, or leaves no receipt starts no agent and records the failure
  against the task; the terminal holding the output that explains it stays.

Rows written before the split carry `role = 'legacy_agent'`: one mixed session,
deliberately not divided or restarted, still serving as that task's agent
terminal until its next launch. The intra-terminal alternate/normal-buffer
history that task 05ffa8d1 landed is unchanged, and a stage transition still
carries the outgoing *agent* terminal's history into its replacement — with
startup noise no longer in it, that chained scrollback is now clean agent
history rather than a mixture of two things.

A launch whose setup runs in a terminal finishes in the background: `POST
/v1/tasks` answers as soon as the task, its workspace and its branch exist,
because startup is repo work of unbounded length and a request held open for it
would time out while the terminal it is waiting for is still printing. A
headless (SDK) launch has no terminal to watch, so its setup still runs where it
did.

That background finish is a **durable lifecycle operation**, not a promise held
in one process. The startup terminal is a daemon session and outlives the server
that started it; the code waiting for it does not. A `task_launch` intent is
therefore written to `lifecycle_operation_intent` *before* the terminal starts,
and the next server generation resolves it from evidence rather than from a held
future: the daemon says whether that shell is still running, and the receipt
says whether setup finished — the startup shell writes it as its last step and
only gets there when everything before it succeeded. A launch whose setup
finished is completed exactly once, rebuilding the agent session from the task's
own record and never re-running setup that already succeeded; anything else
records a failed stage run that names the startup terminal. The same intent
covers the inline path a dormant-task start and the merge agent use.

**A retired terminal is still readable.** Its PTY is gone seconds after the
process exits — the daemon removes the session and the recovery sidecar deletes
its live snapshot — so a client that attached to a retired id would sit in a
retry loop where a failed stage advance's diagnostics should be. Before dropping
a session the daemon writes the headless terminal's **final frame** to a bounded
archive (a rendered frame, not a raw ANSI transcript), at a natural exit and at
an explicit kill alike, and serves it to a snapshot request for the dead id. The
server copies that frame into the task's own record when it retires the
terminal, so it outlives the daemon's snapshot directory;
`GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/terminals` reports `archived` for each terminal and
`GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/terminals/{session_id}/archive` serves the frame. A
retired tab renders that archive read-only — input and resize are refused
because there is nothing to receive them — and survives a desktop restart. A
terminal that finished without an archive says so rather than being presented as
readable.

## Desktop View Commands

`POST /v1/desktop/views/open` (`kanna_open_file`) asks whichever desktop windows
are running to open one of a task's files in that task's main content area, as a
tab beside its agent session. It exists because an agent could already *read* a
task's files but had no way to put one in front of the person watching that
task, short of pasting it into the terminal.

The path is resolved through the same task-workspace resolution
`/v1/tasks/{task_id}/files/content` uses, before anything is queued: a path
outside the task's workspace, a missing file, one over 1 MiB, or one that is not
UTF-8 text is refused with that reason, so a mistyped path is an error the
caller can act on rather than a window that quietly opens nothing. The content
read on the way is discarded — the desktop opens the file from the worktree
itself.

**A requested view is not a shown view.** The response says `requested: true`,
never that a window displayed anything, and the command is advisory in the same
way a pairing prompt is: it is appended to a bounded in-memory lane, not to a
durable table, because nothing about the task depends on it and a request nobody
saw is correctly forgotten. It writes no `task_input` row — this is not an
instruction to the agent, and the durable instruction history must not read as
though it were. The desktop long-polls `GET /v1/desktop/view-commands`
(loopback-only, single-consumer, same `cursor`/`streamId` contract as the
transfer advisory lanes) and opens the file in that task's own tab set. It never
changes which task the operator has selected: the tab is simply there when they
look at that task.

## Mobile Notification Delivery

`POST /v1/mobile/notifications` hands every validated notification to the
desktop-authenticated relay connection, regardless of active paired LAN/KSP
streams. LAN streams are not a notification transport: iOS can suspend a
backgrounded app while its socket still appears writable, so a socket write
cannot prove that a notification was displayed. The relay looks up only that
Firebase user's `pushDevices`, submits one FCM multicast, removes tokens rejected
per-device as `messaging/invalid-argument`, invalid, or unregistered, and
acknowledges the request over the same WebSocket. A payload-wide invalid
argument rejects the multicast call itself rather than appearing as one
device's result.
The server response includes `status` (`accepted`, `deliveryFailed`, or
`noRegisteredDevices`), `acceptedCount`, `failedCount`, and aggregated
`failureReasons`. Each reason has a safe provider code, category, count, and
actionable message; it never identifies a device or includes its token, the
Firebase provider's uncontrolled raw message, credentials, or notification
contents. Older relay acknowledgements without `failureReasons` deserialize as
an empty list during rolling upgrades.

### Zero-device results explain themselves

`noRegisteredDevices` is never a cached value: every call makes the relay
resolve the account's live `pushDevices` registrations (unioned with the
desktop's active anonymous bindings on a dual-identity session). When that
resolves to zero devices, the response carries `noDevicesReason`, read from the
account's registration records:

| `code` | Meaning | Extra fields |
|---|---|---|
| `neverRegistered` | No push device has ever registered for this account. | — |
| `unregistered` | The mobile app retired the last registration (sign-out, or an effect cleanup). | `retiredAt` |
| `tokenRejected` | The push provider rejected the last token as invalid, so the relay retired it. | `retiredAt`, `providerCode`, `retiredByDesktopId` (the desktop whose delivery met the rejection — often a *different* desktop on the same account) |
| `unknown` | The registration was retired before the relay recorded why. | `retiredAt` when known |

Every reason carries a `message` that tells the operator what to do (open Kanna
on the phone while signed in; the app re-registers on launch). The field is
absent when a relay predating it answers, and absent whenever a device was
targeted. Token values never appear in any response or log.

The relay makes this possible by retiring registrations instead of deleting
them: `POST /push/unregister` and the invalid-token reconciliation after a
multicast both keep the `pushDevices` document with `token: null` plus
`retiredAt`, `retiredReason`, and (for rejections) the provider code and the
delivering desktop id. A registration replaces the whole document, so a retired
record disappears the moment the phone registers again. The relay logs each
registration, each unregister outcome (`retired`, `stale`, `alreadyRetired`,
`absent`) with the guard it applied, each provider-rejection retirement, and
each zero-target delivery, always without the token.

### Registration ids make unregister safe

Every mobile registration carries a client-minted `registrationId`, and the
phone's unregister names the id it is retiring. The relay retires only that
registration; a newer registration of the same device — even with the same FCM
token — is left alone (`outcome: "stale"`). Token matching remains the guard
for phones that predate the id, and an unregister with neither retires the
registration unconditionally, as before.

This closes the drop found on 2026-09-03 (task 34047a85): the mobile push
effect re-ran three times in 700 ms as its dependencies settled, each cleanup
fired an unregister for the previous registration carrying the same token the
new run had just re-registered, and the last unregister to land deleted the
live row. On the phone, account registration is now a serialized desired-state
reconciler per device: a cleanup and the next run's registration apply in
order, a failed registration is retried with backoff instead of being
remembered as registered, and a `401` forces a fresh id token on the retry.

### Registration status probe

`GET /v1/mobile/notifications/registration` answers whether the signed-in
account currently has a registered push device, for the desktop's Mobile
Access panel. It uses the distinct `mobile_notification_probe` relay message:
the relay resolves exactly the targets
a real `kanna_notify_mobile` would reach and explains a zero-target result,
without sending, touching delivery watermarks, or spending anonymous rate-limit
budget. The response is `status` (`registered`, `noRegisteredDevices`, or
`unavailable`), `registeredDeviceCount`, and the same `noDevicesReason` on a
zero result (`error` on `unavailable`). The relay advertises the dry run as
`mobileNotifications.version` 2 in `auth_ok`; against a version-1 relay the
server refuses the probe as `unavailable`. The separate wire type also ensures
an older relay cannot mistake a probe for a real push if capability negotiation
regresses. A signed-out desktop's lazily connected anonymous session refuses
it, because the probe is about the account.

`kanna-server` logs every notification outcome — `accepted` with counts,
`deliveryFailed` with the aggregate reasons, `noRegisteredDevices` with the
reason code and its fields, and a relay failure — so a result that changes
between two calls leaves a trace on the desktop that sent it.

Push delivery presents through the operating system while the mobile app is
foregrounded or backgrounded and can reach a suspended or terminated app. It
does not depend on a live app socket. Tapping a versioned task notification
opens its desktop-scoped task whether the tap launches the app or reaches an
already-running app.

The diagnostic categories distinguish invalid tokens, relay IAM permission,
Firebase-project mismatch, APNs credentials, payload validation, rate limits,
temporary provider failures, and an unknown-provider fallback. A
`messaging/mismatched-credential` response whose provider text specifically
reports `cloudmessaging.messages.create` denied is classified as
`relayPermission`; other occurrences remain `firebaseProjectMismatch`. Relay
logs record only the desktop id and these same aggregate safe reasons.

Push registration is one replaceable document per mobile device id. Every app
launch registers the current FCM token and token-rotation callbacks replace it;
an unregister identifies the token it observed so delayed cleanup from an
older app lifecycle cannot delete a newer registration.

If the Firestore lookup or Firebase Admin call rejects as a whole, there are
no per-device results to diagnose. The relay discards the exception rather
than serializing it: its log and WebSocket acknowledgement contain only the
fixed `relayDependency` category and an opaque incident id. The
acknowledgement's `error` field is nevertheless untrusted at the
`kanna-server` boundary and is ignored. `kanna-server` substitutes its own
fixed, categorized `relayRejection` diagnostic and server-owned correlation
value in the `503 Service Unavailable` body/error, so HTTP, CLI, MCP, and
mobile consumers never receive the relay string or the provider's raw
response, project or credential diagnostics, or token material. The
server logs and the `503 Service Unavailable` body carry the
server-owned `category=relayRejection` and correlation value. Relay logs
independently carry `category=relayDependency` and an opaque incident id; the
server correlation and relay incident id are not shared. Operators join the
two records using the desktop id and time window. During a rolling upgrade
this boundary also sanitizes
rejection acknowledgements from an older relay that still serializes raw
provider exceptions.

## Local Consumer Model

The desktop app starts `kanna-server` and supplies its config.
Local mobile development points the React Native client at the LAN URL exposed by `kanna-server`.
Consumers such as `kanna-cli` and `kanna-cli mcp serve` target the same route surface so product behavior stays consistent across clients.
The CLI remains the shell/script interface; MCP is the structured agent-tool interface.

## CLI Task Actions

- `kanna-cli task send-input --task-id <TASK_ID> --message <MESSAGE> [--server-url <URL>]` calls `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/input`. Input is accepted only for an active daemon PTY session, fenced to the PTY process ID observed before acceptance while the server holds the task lifecycle lease. The daemon may retain it behind an active human draft, but never for a later run or stage. A successful acknowledgement prints `{ "ok": true }`; an absent or concurrently replaced session returns HTTP 409 with `reason: "no_live_agent_session"`, the latest run status/finish time when available, and explicit `kanna_resume_task` / `kanna_rerun_stage` recovery guidance. If the acknowledgement is lost after acceptance, the server reports uncertain delivery so callers do not retry blindly.
- `kanna-cli task send-raw-input --task-id <TASK_ID> (--keys <NAMES> | --bytes <HEX>) [--encoding hex|base64] [--source operator|manager] [--server-url <URL>]` calls `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/raw-input`, the discrete-keystroke counterpart to `send-input`: no Enter is appended, nothing is queued behind a draft, and no `task_input` row is written. `--keys down,enter` dismisses or answers a menu; `--keys escape` closes a dialog; `--bytes 1b5b42` writes an arbitrary sequence with nothing added. Byte payloads are decoded server-side, so no shell is ever asked to produce an escape character, and a carriage return in `--bytes` is refused with a pointer at `--keys enter`, which declares the submission boundary. `--list-keys` prints the accepted vocabulary offline. The response's `writes` array reports each key as `written`, `uncertain`, or `not_written`; a non-zero exit with `delivery_uncertain` means some keys may already be at the terminal and the call must not be resent. See [Raw terminal keys](#raw-terminal-keys).
- `kanna-cli task advance-stage --task-id <TASK_ID> [--source operator|manager] [--next-stage-agent-provider <PROVIDER>] [--next-stage-model <MODEL>] [--next-stage-effort <EFFORT>] [--next-stage-provider-source operator|manager|agent] [--server-url <URL>]` calls `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/actions/advance-stage` and prints the action response as JSON. Omitted source is recorded as `unspecified`; automatic policy transitions are `auto`. The next-stage provider flags are the per-advance override described above.
- `kanna-cli task signal-merge --task-id <TASK_ID> --branch <HEAD> --target <BASE> --summary <SUMMARY> [--pr-url <URL>] [--server-url <URL>]` sends an ordinary request to the repository's merge agent.
- `kanna-cli task resume --task-id <TASK_ID> [--server-url <URL>]` calls `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/actions/resume`. It accepts a latest `cancelled` or `failed` run whose daemon session is dead. It also accepts a latest `running` run only after a daemon `List` proves the run's recorded session is absent; the desktop uses that form when an attach after restart discovers a session lost with the old daemon. It resumes the provider conversation when its durable transcript and original worktree pass the shared revision-resume checks; unsupported or missing provider context starts fresh and records `resumeFallbackReason`, while task-state precondition failures return an explanatory conflict. A present session returns a conflict for a running run and restores a false interruption for a previously interrupted run, so the route never creates a duplicate provider process. An empty route-level 404 identifies an older server that does not provide the action. Callers may use `rerun-stage` when recovery is unavailable or a deliberately fresh conversation is acceptable.
- `kanna-cli task rerun-stage --task-id <TASK_ID> [--server-url <URL>]` calls `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/actions/rerun-stage`. This is always an explicit fresh provider conversation, not recovery.
- `kanna-cli task children --task-id <TASK_ID> [--server-url <URL>]` calls `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/children` and prints the direct-child history as JSON. It is the typed no-MCP fallback for `kanna_list_task_children`, so it reproduces the route's field set rather than summarizing it.
- `kanna-cli machine transfer-peers [--machine-id <MACHINE_ID>] [--server-url <URL>]` calls `GET /v1/transfers/peers` and prints the machines a task can be moved to or from, with each one's current route.
- `kanna-cli task push --task-id <TASK_ID> --to-machine <MACHINE_OR_PEER_ID> [--transport auto|lan|cloud] [--intent-key <KEY>] [--machine-id <MACHINE_ID>] [--server-url <URL>]` calls `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/actions/push-to-peer`. It runs on the machine that owns the task, so `--machine-id` is how a task is pushed off a sibling machine. It schedules the transfer; the response reports `moved: false`.
- `kanna-cli task pull --source-task-id <TASK_ID> --from-machine <MACHINE_OR_PEER_ID> [--transport auto|lan|cloud] [--server-url <URL>]` calls `POST /v1/transfers/actions/pull-task`. It always runs on the machine the task is moving to and takes no `--machine-id`. It delivers the request; the response reports `moved: false` and a `requestId` that is stable for repeats inside the source's request window.
- `kanna-cli task transfers --task-id <TASK_ID> [--machine-id <MACHINE_ID>] [--server-url <URL>]` calls `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/transfers` and prints the recorded moves with the coarse `pending` / `completed` / `failed` / `rejected` verdict. This is the surface that answers whether a scheduled move happened; a push or pull result never does. A task id that names no task *here* still answers when a transfer was recorded against it — a pull this machine asked for and the source refused — rather than 404.

### Mobile build observations

`POST /v1/mobile/build` accepts the paired installation's self-reported
`environment`, `channel`, `runtimeVersion`, `nativeVersion`, `nativeBuild`,
`updateId`, and `source` (`ota`, `embedded`, `development`, `unknown`). Nullable
identity fields mean unknown; embedded/development launches report no applied
OTA id. The existing LAN pairing credential authenticates the installation;
the server derives the device id from that credential, never the body. Relay
account authority alone cannot report for an installation. Reports persist in
the pairing store under its existing mutation lock, with a server-written
`reportedAtUnixMs` (Unix milliseconds). Unpairing removes the observation. These are diagnostic claims,
never authorization inputs.

`GET /v1/mobile/builds` requires desktop-local access and returns `desktopId`
and `devices: [{deviceId, deviceName, build}]`. `build` is null for older clients
that have never reported. It explicitly projects public diagnostic fields and
never exposes secret hashes or push credentials. `kd mobile ota` reads this
endpoint; it does not read the pairing file or SQLite. Mobile reporting is best
effort during trusted LAN connection setup and does not block using an older
server. Remote-only operation does not refresh this observation.


## Event subscriptions and harness delivery

`POST /v1/event-subscriptions` (`kanna_subscribe_events`) registers a manager
by `taskId` and one task/parent/repository scope (its own repository by default).
It is a direct-desktop control, not a relay or paired-device endpoint. The
manager itself is always excluded. Registration immediately returns any
already-settled work, then the server owns observation independently of MCP
request lifetime or provider background execution. Filters and cursors are the
existing task-event implementation; no new completion detector is introduced.

The durable `event_subscription` row binds to the manager's current run,
stage, and branch. Stage replacement or closure stops the worker. One pending
page bounds the mailbox; later events stay in the feed until it is acknowledged.
`POST /v1/event-subscriptions/{id}/read` (`kanna_read_event_subscription`) is a
non-destructive read unless `acknowledgeBatchId` matches the pending batch.
Only that acknowledgement advances the stored cursor. A stale batch is refused;
CAS revisions prevent a late wait or delivery response overwriting an ack.
Registration retries reuse the active mailbox and reject conflicting settings.
`POST /v1/event-subscriptions/{id}/unsubscribe` stops observation and preserves
the pending page. Corresponding typed CLI commands are `task subscribe-events`,
`task read-event-subscription`, and `task unsubscribe-events`.

The first returned page is already observed by the registering caller. A later
page receives one coalesced wake. Wakes contain only the subscription and batch
identity; the mailbox contains the actual events. Delivery is a separate adapter:

- `input` (default): a labelled Kanna supervisory message through the existing
  logical-input queue, task mutation guard, and daemon PID fence. Delivered
  messages carry the reserved `engine` input source, unavailable to public
  caller declarations. A daemon-held input reports `wakeState: queued`;
  `notified` means submission was accepted, not that the model read or acted
  on it. No composer or draft handling is duplicated.
- `codex_app_server` (explicit opt-in): connect through `codex app-server proxy`,
  initialize, verify the recorded native thread's worktree (or discover the unique loaded
  root thread for that worktree on a fresh run), then call
  `turn/start` with empty `input` and a standalone `toolOutput`. This requires
  a Codex harness sharing the app server and exposing a unique loaded root thread for the stage worktree;
  generic MCP notifications do not establish that capability. A failed native
  delivery does not silently fall back and risk a duplicate turn.
- `poll`: retain the mailbox without waking; `wakeState: ready` explicitly
  reports this. It is for a harness that supplies its own scheduling.

Server startup resumes active rows. A row left `sending` by a crash becomes
`uncertain`; its page remains readable and the layer does not blindly submit
another turn. The layer retries only what provably never reached the
daemon and is expected to clear on its own — `daemon_unavailable`,
`daemon_state_unknown`, and the task-mutation lease conflict — by leaving
the batch `pending` with the failure text in `error` and re-attempting on
the next notification, so an app upgrade's daemon handoff delays a wake
instead of dropping it. Everything else parks on the mailbox as
`wakeState: error`: an uncertain or draft-held submission whose bytes may
already have reached the PTY, a stale subscription, a genuinely dead
session, an unsupported adapter, and the Codex thread-identity refusals.
Retrying is never the mailbox's own recovery from a delivery that might
have landed. Watch errors, including
partial machine coverage, become pending attention batches and receive a wake;
acknowledging that error pauses observation so a persistent fault cannot create
a wake loop. Registering again with the same settings resumes that paused
position. Only an explicit unsubscribe discards it for a fresh registration;
reconcile gaps and current state first if the cursor itself cannot be resumed.
Persistence of a mailbox is not an exactly-once delivery or cursor-retention
promise: relay resilience and durable cursor recovery remain task f63b3698's
work. Deploy that recovery before relying on unattended cross-machine
continuity. A fresh level-triggered scan is useful independently, including
when an idle task produced no new event after observation began.

MCP dispatch is concurrent and bounded to 64 in-flight requests: a long wait
cannot serialize mailbox reads behind itself. Subscriptions need no long MCP
call at all. No debounce values change. The human sidebar receives KSP
`ServerFrame::StateChanged` directly, independently of the debounced event feed.
