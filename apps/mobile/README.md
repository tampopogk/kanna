# Kanna Mobile

## Production QA

Before TestFlight external testing or App Store submission, run the production
mobile QA gate in [docs/testing/mobile-production-qa-gate.md](../../docs/testing/mobile-production-qa-gate.md).

## OTA Runtime Version

`apps/mobile/src/mobileEnvironments.json` is the source of truth for the mobile
OTA `runtimeVersion`. Staging and production builds use that value in the Expo
Updates request header and only accept OTA bundles with the same runtime.

Bump `runtimeVersion` whenever a change touches native code, native config, the
Expo SDK, native dependencies, or `plugins/withKannaNativeIdentity.js`. JS-only
changes keep the same `runtimeVersion` and are OTA-deliverable.

The Android identity/config slice uses `runtimeVersion` `2.2.5` for dev and
`2.2.4` for staging/production. OTA updates built for an earlier runtime are
not compatible; install a native build with the matching runtime before
publishing or applying an update.

`2.2.4` adds the Android package identities and keeps cleartext LAN access off
for shipped identities. Dev advances once more to `2.2.5` because its emulator
identity explicitly permits the task-scoped HTTP development endpoint.

`2.2.3` replaces the pre-masked mobile app icon with full-bleed iOS/legacy
artwork and separate Android adaptive-icon layers. The generated native icon
assets therefore require a new binary even though the app's in-app UI is
unchanged.

`2.2.1` aligns Expo SDK 57 and its native modules on Expo's compatible patch
set after `2.2.0` combined a newer image-manipulator framework with an older
Expo Modules Core ABI.

`2.2.0` added `expo-image-picker` and `expo-image-manipulator` for composer
photo attachments — new native dependencies, so that feature ships only with a
new binary and cannot reach a `2.1.4` install over OTA.

Development builds (`KANNA_APP_ENV=dev`) do not configure OTA updates; they run
from Metro/dev-client.

## About This Build

Open **More → About this build** in the mobile app to inspect the installed
native application version and build number, OTA runtime version, app
environment and channel, and the JavaScript source currently running. The row
stays collapsed until pressed so repository commands remain the primary More
screen content.

A full UUID under **Running source** identifies a downloaded Expo OTA update;
tap it to copy the exact update ID. **Embedded bundle** means the app is running
the JavaScript packaged in the installed native binary. **Development bundle
(Metro)** means a dev-client session is loading JavaScript from Metro rather
than Expo Updates.

Physical-device builds in every environment, including staging and production,
default to the checked-in `apps/mobile/VERSION`. They do not read desktop
release status or derive a marketing version from the active desktop RC. The
root desktop `VERSION` is retained only as a compatibility fallback when the
mobile file is absent. `KANNA_APP_VERSION` is an explicit diagnostic/build
override; it changes only the native marketing version and does not change the
selected native identity, bundle id, Firebase/relay environment, OTA channel,
runtime version, or signing behavior.

## Production iOS Archive

Use the repo-native wrapper for App Store Connect builds:

```bash
./kd mobile archive --production --ref release/0.2 --build-number <next-app-store-build-number>
```

`--ref <branch|tag|sha>` is required: the archive is built from the working
tree, so `kd` refuses a dirty worktree or a ref that is not the checked-out
commit, and prints the resolved commit as `Source: <ref> (<short sha>)` so a
submitted build traces back to its source. After export and before any optional
upload, it pushes an annotated
`mobile-archive-v<marketing-version>-<build-number>` tag containing the ref,
commit, runtime version, marketing version, build number, bundle id, and
timestamp. That tag is the durable ledger; `.build/` is disposable.

The command runs Expo CNG locally with `KANNA_APP_ENV=prod`, keeps the generated
`apps/mobile/ios/` directory uncommitted, archives the generated Xcode workspace,
and exports an IPA under `.build/mobile/ios-production/`. It uses the production
bundle id `build.kanna.app`, display name `Kanna`, and Apple team
`EA4J68749Z` from `app.config.ts` and `mobileEnvironments.json`. Expo SDK 57
generates the production workspace and scheme as `Kanna`; the dev and staging
workspaces are `KannaDev` and `KannaStaging` respectively.

By default, the App Store marketing version comes from `apps/mobile/VERSION`.
Pass `--version <version>` for an explicit one-build override. If the mobile
file is absent, the root desktop `VERSION` remains a compatibility fallback;
an empty or malformed mobile file fails instead of silently falling back.
Always pass a monotonically increasing `--build-number`; this becomes
`CFBundleVersion`.

Mobile marketing versions are independent of desktop release versions. A new
binary after an App Store version is released needs a new mobile marketing
version; each production archive needs a globally increasing build number;
only native compatibility changes bump Expo `runtimeVersion`. See
[`docs/specs/mobile-ota-updates.md`](../../docs/specs/mobile-ota-updates.md#native-versioning-and-archive-provenance)
for the complete policy.

To upload after export, configure Transporter API-key credentials locally and
run:

```bash
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID=<key-id> \
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID=<issuer-id> \
./kd mobile archive --production --ref release/0.2 \
  --build-number <next-build-number> --upload
```

Transporter expects the matching private key at
`~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/AuthKey_<key-id>.p8`. Use `--dry-run` to print
the full prebuild/archive/export/upload plan without contacting Apple.

Apple requires App Store Connect uploads to be built with Xcode 26 or later
using an iOS 26 SDK or later as of April 28, 2026:
