/**
 * Stage colour for task rows, themed from the app icon.
 *
 * The icon (`assets/icon.png`) is a stack of rounded task pills running from a
 * hot orange/rose row at the top down through magenta, purple and indigo to a
 * cool blue/slate row, with one green dot. Those pills *are* task rows, so the
 * list borrows their colours directly: every hex in `KANNA_ICON_PALETTE` was
 * sampled out of that PNG rather than invented alongside it.
 *
 * Everything a row needs is derived from a single accent here, so iterating on
 * the look is a one-file change: move a stage to another palette entry, or
 * retune the blends, and every surface that renders a task follows.
