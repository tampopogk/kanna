//! Forwards the transfer sidecar's *advisory* events to the renderer.
//!
//! What used to live here — deliveries, consumer incarnations, 30-second
//! leases, ack/nack, phase claims and a 1 Hz redelivery sweeper — existed for
//! one reason: to elect a single renderer window to perform transfer
//! orchestration, and to survive that window disappearing. Orchestration is
//! `kanna-server`'s now, and the four state-mutating lifecycle events never
//! leave that process, so none of the election machinery has anything left to
//! elect.
//!
//! What remains is a plain fan-out of the events a *window* is genuinely for:
//! pairing prompts, which need a human, and remote terminal frames, which need
//! a terminal. Losing one costs a prompt nobody was there to answer, never a
//! transfer step.
//!
//! The same long-poll shape carries `kanna-server`'s desktop view commands —
//! an agent asking a window to open a file for the person watching the task.
//! It is advisory for exactly the same reason: a window that is not there
//! loses the request, and nothing about the task depended on it.
