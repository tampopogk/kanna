 * Everything the main content area needs to host a task's views as tabs.

 * host renders the same view components the modal layer used to, and those
 * take their repo, worktree, remote-loader and remembered-view-state inputs
 * from `useAppModals`. Threading a dozen individual props through `MainPanel`
 * would say less and drift faster.
