Help the user create a workflow definition — the ordered list of stages a task flows through.

Read the running version's workflow manual first with `kanna_guide {"topic":"workflows"}` or, when MCP is unavailable, `kanna-cli guide workflows`. Use it together with `.kanna/workflows/schema.json` when that local schema exists.

1. Ask what the workflow is: which stages, what each does, whether each transition is manual or automatic, and what setup/teardown each stage's environment needs.
2. Write the workflow JSON to `.kanna/workflows/{name}.json` in the current repo.
3. Confirm the file was written and show the user its contents.

## Workflow JSON Format

When `.kanna/workflows/schema.json` exists in this repo, read it before writing. It rejects unknown fields either way.

```json
{
  "$schema": "./schema.json",
  "name": "<must match the filename without .json>",
  "description": "<human-readable description>",
  "revision_limit": 5,
  "environments": {
    "<env-name>": { "setup": ["<shell command>"], "teardown": ["<shell command>"] }
  },
  "stages": [
    {
      "name": "<stage-name, unique within the workflow>",
      "description": "<human-readable description>",
      "agent": "<agent directory name>",
      "prompt": "$TASK_PROMPT",
      "agent_provider": "<optional provider or ordered provider list>",
      "environment": "<optional env-name from environments above>",
      "policy": { "transition": "manual", "revision_transition": "auto" },
      "post": {
        "name": "commit",
        "agent": "commit",
        "prompt": "Commit the relevant work for this task. Original task: $TASK_PROMPT"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- `revision_limit` — agent-requested revision rounds a task may spend before Kanna parks it for its human. Defaults to 5; `0` disables the cap.
- `agent` — omit for a gate stage: no agent spawns and the stage just waits for a manual advance.
- `prompt` — the stage assignment, rendered under `## Your Task` after the agent's `## Agent Instructions`.
- `policy.transition` — `manual` (the user advances) or `auto` (a successful stage result advances). Optional `policy.revision_transition` controls runs entered through a revision request and defaults to `transition`.
- `post` — tail work injected into the stage's *running* agent session when the stage transitions forward; `agent` is the fallback spawned if that session is dead. A commit step belongs here, not in its own stage.
- `agent_provider` — a single provider (`"opencode"`) when the stage requires one, or an ordered array (`["claude", "codex", "copilot", "opencode", "antigravity"]`) so Kanna picks the first installed. Valid on stages and posts. Each entry is a compact provider selector, `provider[-model[-effort]]`: an optional model rides after the provider and is passed to the CLI verbatim (`claude-fable`, `codex-gpt-5.6-sol`), and a recognized trailing effort token (`lo`/`low`, `med`/`medium`, `hi`/`high`, `xhi`/`xhigh`, `max`) sets the reasoning effort (`claude-fable-hi`, `codex-gpt-6-astra-lo`). Every selector in an ordered list carries its own coherent model/effort pair — a fallback candidate never inherits the leader's model — and anything under-specified inherits the provider CLI's own defaults.

## Prompt Variables

| Variable | Resolves to |
|----------|-------------|
| `$TASK_PROMPT` | The user's original task description |
| `$BRANCH` | The branch of the workspace this stage runs in |
| `$BASE_REF` | The task's base ref, for diffing and rebasing |
| `$SOURCE_WORKTREE` | The previous stage's worktree path |
| `$PREV_RESULT` | The latest finished run's result of any kind — after a stage with a post, that is the post's result |
| `$PREV_MAIN_RESULT` | The previous stage agent's own run result, skipping posts — use this when a stage must read what the previous stage agent reported |
| `$STAGE_TRIGGER` | How the current stage was entered: `auto`, `operator`, `manager`, or `unspecified` |
| `$KANNA_TASK_ID` | Resolved from the session environment at runtime |

## Built-in Agents

`plan` (records the implementation plan a build stage follows) · `implement` (implements the task) · `commit` (commits the relevant work) · `review` (QA review that verifies coverage and requests revisions) · `qa-dispatcher` (fans specialty reviews out as child tasks) · `review-ui`, `review-security`, `review-perf`, `review-concurrency`, `review-migration`, `review-compat` (specialty reviewers) · `pr` (creates a pull request) · `approve` (signals the merge master for an approved PR) · `merge` (safely merges branches and PRs) · `task-manager` (orchestrates tasks, dependencies, and merge-master handoffs) · `ship` (inspects and executes the repository's declared release procedure) · `setup`, `agent-factory`, `workflow-factory`, `config-factory` (configuration helpers).

## Completion

```
kanna_complete_stage {"task_id": "$KANNA_TASK_ID", "status": "success", "summary": "Created workflow: <name>"}
```

or `"status": "failure"` with why the workflow could not be created.

CLI fallback: `kanna-cli stage-complete --task-id "$KANNA_TASK_ID" --status success --summary "Created workflow: <name>"`, or `--status failure --summary "<why the workflow could not be created>"`.
