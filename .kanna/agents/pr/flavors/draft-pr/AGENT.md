You are in a worktree branched from the task branch. Publish the work as a draft GitHub pull request. This stage's prompt explicitly authorizes pushing the branch and creating the PR.

1. Confirm the source branch is committed with `git -C $SOURCE_WORKTREE status --short`. If task-related changes are uncommitted, record stage failure explaining that the commit stage did not finish cleanly.
2. Record the starting identity before anything rewrites it: `git rev-parse HEAD`, `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, and `git -C $SOURCE_WORKTREE rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. The rebase rewrites the shas and the rename discards the branch names; step 6 matches on what you recorded here.
3. Fetch, then validate the base ref — see "Validate the base ref" below. It resolves the target branch this PR should land on, which is not automatically `$BASE_REF`.
4. Rebase onto the validated target: `$BASE_REF` when step 3 confirmed it is still live, otherwise the `--onto` form described there.
5. If the rebase conflicts, resolve only unambiguous conflicts from the task's own changes; otherwise abort the rebase and record failure.
6. Check whether an open PR already covers this work — see "Reuse an existing PR" below. If one does, update it and skip steps 7-8.
7. Rename the branch to something meaningful based on the commits, then push with `git push -u origin HEAD`.
8. Create the draft PR against the validated target from step 3: `gh pr create --draft --base <target>`, with a clear title and description. The title and body must carry {{> no-ai-attribution}} End the body with a `Kanna-Task: $KANNA_TASK_ID` line, and make it the only trailer, so a later run can find this PR after the branch has been renamed.

If `gh` CLI commands fail due to sandbox restrictions, disable the sandbox for those commands.

## Validate the base ref

`$BASE_REF` is the base the task was created from, not a promise that the base is still a live path to the default branch. A PR that merges cleanly into an abandoned integration branch looks exactly like a healthy PR, so the check has to happen here, before the PR exists. A draft is no exception: it lands through the same target once it is readied.

Resolve the default branch with `git symbolic-ref --quiet --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, falling back to `git remote show origin`. If `$BASE_REF` is empty, the default branch is the target and nothing below applies. Otherwise strip any `origin/` prefix and ask, in order:

1. **Is the base the default branch?** Then it is the target; stop checking.
2. **Does the base still exist on the remote?** `git ls-remote --heads origin <base>` — no output means it is gone.
3. **Does the base have an open PR of its own?** `gh pr list --state open --head <base> --json number,url,baseRefName`. That PR is what carries a stacked base to the default branch; without one, nothing does. If the parent PR's own base is not the default branch either, ask this same question of it — follow at most three links, and treat a chain that does not reach the default branch as unresolved.
4. **Is the base already contained in the default branch?** `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/<base> origin/<default>` succeeding means the base has already landed and targeting it adds nothing.

The base is live when it is the default branch, or when the chain of open PRs starting at it reaches the default branch. It is a dead end when it is gone from the remote, has no open PR, or is already contained in the default branch.

**Never retarget unconditionally.** A PR stacked on a live feature branch is a legitimate pattern; moving it to the default branch would drag the parent's commits into this PR or break the stack. When the base is live, keep it and name the parent PR that carries it in your report.

For a dead-end base, retarget only when the task's own commits replay cleanly onto the default branch:

```
git rebase --onto origin/<default> origin/<base> HEAD
```

Rebasing onto `origin/<base>` as the upstream is what keeps the base branch's own commits out of this PR. Afterwards, confirm `git log --oneline origin/<default>..HEAD` lists only this task's commits. If the rebase conflicts, or the base tip can no longer be resolved (the branch was deleted before you fetched it), `git rebase --abort`, create no PR, and record stage failure asking a human which branch this work should target. **Stopping to ask is a correct outcome; landing the work on a branch nobody will merge is not.**

Do not trigger on how far the base is behind the default branch, how long ago it was last committed to, or what it is named. Long-lived stack parents drift behind and go quiet without being abandoned, and deciding on those signals would break stacking. Mention the distance in your report as context; decide on the questions above.

## Reuse an existing PR

Step 7 renames the branch, so an earlier PR for this task can be sitting on a branch name this worktree no longer has — and an unconditional `gh pr create` then opens a second PR for the same commits. Match on the work, not just the current branch name. List the open PRs once:

```
gh pr list --state open --limit 100 --json number,url,headRefName,headRefOid,baseRefName,isDraft,title
```

A PR covers this work when any of these holds:

- its `headRefOid` equals the sha you recorded in step 2, or the current `HEAD`;
- its `headRefName` is one of this task's branch names — the branch recorded in step 2, the source worktree's branch, or a `task-$KANNA_TASK_ID` branch on the remote (`git ls-remote --heads origin "task-$KANNA_TASK_ID*"`);
- `gh pr list --state open --search "$KANNA_TASK_ID in:body"` returns it — PRs created by step 8 carry that trailer;
- the rebase rewrote your commits and, after fetching that head branch, `git cherry origin/<headRefName> HEAD` marks every one of your commits `-`, meaning it already carries equivalent patches.

Ready PRs count as matches too, not just drafts — an earlier run, another flavor, or a human may have opened the PR that covers this work. When one does, update it instead of opening a second one:

1. Do not rename the branch — renaming and pushing a new branch orphans the PR.
2. Confirm you are not about to discard work: `git cherry HEAD origin/<headRefName>` must print no `+` lines. If it does, that branch holds commits you do not have — stop and report instead of force-pushing over them.
3. Push with `git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD:refs/heads/<headRefName>`.
4. If validating the base ref retargeted this work, move the PR too: `gh pr edit <number> --base <target>`.
5. Refresh the title and description if the work changed. The title and body must carry {{> no-ai-attribution}} Add the `Kanna-Task: $KANNA_TASK_ID` line if the body lacks it, and make it the only trailer, then report that PR's URL as this stage's result. Leave the PR's draft state alone — never convert a ready PR back to a draft.

If you conclude the match belongs to different work and a separate PR is genuinely right, say why in your report. A second PR for the same commits is a defect, not a detail.

## Completion

Record success with the full PR URL in both the summary and the metadata, whether you created the draft PR or updated a PR that already covered this work:

```
kanna_complete_stage {"task_id": "$KANNA_TASK_ID", "status": "success", "summary": "Created draft PR <the PR URL>", "metadata": {"pr_url": "<the PR URL>"}}
```

If the PR cannot be created, or the base ref is a dead end you could not safely retarget, record `"status": "failure"` with the reason.

CLI fallback: `kanna-cli stage-complete --task-id "$KANNA_TASK_ID" --status success --summary "Created draft PR <url>" --metadata '{"pr_url": "<url>"}'`, or `--status failure --summary "<why draft PR creation is blocked>"`.
