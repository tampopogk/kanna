// WHAT BREAKS IN KANNA IF THIS PIN FAILS: every OpenCode PTY task's
// `runtime_status` — the sidebar's working/idle indicator, task activity, the
// `task.awaiting_input` feed, and transfer finalization, which waits for Idle
// before it dares type a quit command at the source agent.
//
// The daemon reads status off rendered terminal rows, so it can only ever know
// what OpenCode draws. Its OpenCode rules (crates/daemon/src/detection/rules.json)
// pin three strings, each in a version-ranged vocabulary entry:
//
//   inFlightMarkers           the working footer  -> Busy
//   composerStatusSeparators  the composer's mode/model line -> Idle
//   permissionActionMarkers   the permission dialog's action row -> Waiting
//
// Those entries carry the CLI versions they were measured against, so a new
// spelling is *added* beside the old one rather than replacing it — someone on
// the team is still running the older release.
//
// Those are pinned at the unit layer against captured frames
// (crates/daemon/tests/fixtures/opencode/), which proves the matcher reads the
// frames correctly but cannot notice the day OpenCode stops drawing them. This
// file is that canary: it asserts the installed CLI still renders each marker,
// and names the constant to update when one moves.
//
// It exists because the previous idle marker — a `›` composer glyph — was
// pinned only against a hand-written fixture. The CLI stopped drawing it, no
// test noticed, and live OpenCode sessions sat at Busy forever. OpenCode moves
// fast enough that the working footer's own wording changed from "escape
// interrupt" to "esc interrupt" between two runs of this investigation:
// docs/2026-08-08-opencode-live-idle-detection-e2e-gap.md.
//
// The second describe block below pins the spawn *shape* these markers are read
// off: that Kanna's argv still opens a TUI which outlives its first turn. The
// markers and the shape fail independently, and while Kanna spawned
// `opencode run --interactive` the shape was the one that was broken.
