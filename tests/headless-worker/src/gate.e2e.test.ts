/**
 * Linux Phase 1's exit gate, exercised through the real wiring on whatever
 * platform it runs on.
 *
 * Every assertion is against durable state — rows the server wrote, branches
 * and worktrees git actually has — and never against terminal output. A gate
 * that scraped a terminal would pass on a screenful of the right characters
 * while the record behind it was empty, which is the failure mode the input
 * ledger exists to prevent.
 *
 * The cases run in order and share one worker and one task on purpose: the
 * gate is a *lifecycle*, and a task that was created, executed, instructed,
 * completed, forked and closed in sequence is the thing being proven.
