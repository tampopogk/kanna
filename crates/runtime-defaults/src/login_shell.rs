//! The shell Kanna runs repository commands and PTY tasks through.
//!
//! Four product surfaces need one: the setup/teardown supervisor
//! (`kanna-server`'s `workspace_commands`), login-shell PATH discovery
//! (`task_creator::environment`), the PTY bootstrap a task's agent CLI runs
//! inside (`task_creator`), and the desktop app's own shell tabs and
//! `run_script`. They must agree, and until Linux support they all simply
//! said `/bin/zsh`.
//!
//! It lives here rather than in `kanna-server` because the desktop is a
//! separate process that cannot call into the server's private modules. The
//! desktop had its own copy of the old answer -- a `/bin/zsh` literal in
//! TypeScript -- which is exactly the split brain this crate exists to
//! prevent; it now asks Tauri, which asks this policy.
//!
//! macOS keeps saying exactly that: `/bin/zsh` ships with the system, is the
//! default login shell, and every existing expectation -- including the argv
//! vectors asserted in tests -- is preserved byte for byte.
//!
//! Linux cannot. Phase 0 measured a stock Ubuntu image with **no `zsh` at
//! all**, and found that installing one is not the fix either: a freshly
//! installed `zsh` with no `~/.zshrc` runs `zsh-newuser-install`, an
//! interactive first-run wizard that clears the screen and waits for a
//! keypress -- which is what the PTY bootstrap then sees instead of its setup
//! output. The policy therefore has to name a shell that is *present and
//! non-interactive out of the box*:
//!
//! 1. `$SHELL`, when it is an absolute, executable `bash` or `zsh`. A user who
//!    chose one of those has startup files, and PATH discovery exists
//!    precisely to read them.
//! 2. `/bin/bash`, which every mainstream distribution ships and which needs
//!    no first-run configuration.
//! 3. `/bin/sh` as a last resort. On Debian derivatives that is `dash`, which
//!    accepts `-l -i -c` and is enough to run a command, though its rc
//!    semantics are thinner than the two above.
//!
//! "Login" is spelled differently by these shells and the difference is not
//! cosmetic: `dash` rejects `--login` outright (`Illegal option --`) and wants
//! `-l`. That is why the argument vectors live here beside the path instead of
//! being written out at each call site.
