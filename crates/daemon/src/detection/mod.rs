//! Agent-status detection: the rules the daemon classifies terminal sessions
//! with, and where they come from.
//!
//! The daemon remains the classification authority and the verdict vocabulary
//! is unchanged — `busy`, `waiting`, `idle`, each a positive match on
//! something the provider drew. What lives here is the answer to two questions
//! the old design answered badly:
//!
//! - **Where do the patterns live?** In [`rules.json`], bundled into the
//!   binary and overridable from a machine-local file that hot-reloads. A
//!   provider that reshuffles its footer used to cost a daemon release.
//! - **Which patterns apply?** The ones measured against the CLI version this
//!   session is actually running. One machine on the newest Claude and another
//!   several releases behind need different patterns, and a constant is a
//!   single slot.
//!
//! See `docs/specs/agent-status-detection-rules.md`.

// This module is compiled into both the `kanna_daemon` library and the daemon
// binary, which declare their own module trees over the same files. Parts of
// the surface have exactly one of those two callers — the daemon binary probes
// CLI versions and reloads rules, while the library serves `kanna-server`'s
// replay and the composer helpers — so per-crate dead-code analysis flags the
// half it cannot see. Same reason as `proc_info`.
