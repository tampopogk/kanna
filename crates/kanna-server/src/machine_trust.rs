//! Server-owned automatic same-account LAN trust.
//!
//! Distinct from `pairing::PairingStore`, which is the human/mobile QR
//! pairing ceremony and only ever holds an *inbound* secret hash. This store
//! holds both directions of automatic desktop-to-desktop trust:
//! - `inbound`: hashes of secrets other same-account desktops present to
//!   *this* desktop's machine-invoke gateway (this desktop is the target).
//! - `outbound`: plaintext bearer secrets *this* desktop presents when
//!   calling another same-account desktop (this desktop is the source),
//!   plus that target's TLS trust anchor once one exists.
//! - `pending`: a durably-recorded, not-yet-acknowledged outbound bootstrap
//!   in flight, keyed by target so a lost acknowledgement and a retry
//!   resend the same candidate secret instead of minting a second one.
//!
//! Every record is bound to the account UID and environment it was minted
//! under, on a lease no longer than [`LEASE_MS`], so it fails closed on
//! expiry, on a restart that finds a corrupted or over-permissive file, and
//! on an account change - with no unbounded credential and no dependency on
//! an edge-triggered sign-out callback succeeding. `kanna-server` is the
//! lifecycle owner of this store; nothing outside this crate reads or writes
//! it directly.
