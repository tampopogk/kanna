//! Runtime recovery for a Claude resume the provider itself rejects.
//!
//! Kanna checks before a resume that the provider transcript is on disk
//! (`task_creator::resume`), and falls back to a fresh conversation when it is
//! not. That preflight cannot cover the second failure mode: the CLI starts,
//! reads its own store, decides the session is unusable, prints its
//! missing-session error and exits. Nothing ran, but to the daemon it looks
//! exactly like an agent that died — the run is recorded failed and the task is
//! parked with a dead session and a transcript that will never come back.
//!
//! This module classifies that one narrow case and relaunches the same stage,
//! in the same worktree, once, without `--resume`. Everything else is left to
//! the caller's normal terminal-state handling: an agent that genuinely failed
//! must still be reported as failed.
