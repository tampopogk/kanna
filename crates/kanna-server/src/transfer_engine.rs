//! Server-side task-transfer orchestration.
//!
//! Push, import, approve/reject, commit handling and failure reporting used to
//! live in `apps/desktop/src/stores/transfer.ts`, driven by whichever renderer
//! window had been elected to receive the sidecar's lifecycle events. That made
//! a transfer implicitly require an open, signed-in window, and on 2026-08-06 a
//! window that vanished mid-transfer took the finalization signal, the failure
//! report, and the commit acknowledgment with it — three failures, one design.
//!
//! The work lives here instead, in the process that already owns the DB rows,
//! the task lifecycle actions, the daemon event stream, and (since the sidecar
//! re-parent) the transfer control plane. What used to be at-least-once
//! delivery to a window is exactly-once execution in one process, and the four
//! lifecycle events that only existed in an in-memory Tauri queue are now rows
//! in a durable work queue that survives a restart.
