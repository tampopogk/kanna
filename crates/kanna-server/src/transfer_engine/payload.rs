//! The wire contract for a task transfer payload.
//!
//! This is the sender/receiver agreement that used to live in
//! `apps/desktop/src/utils/taskTransfer.ts`. It moved with the orchestration:
//! the payload is now built by the source's `kanna-server` and validated by the
//! destination's, so no renderer has to be running at either end.
//!
//! Validation is deliberately strict and total. A payload arrives from another
//! machine, and everything downstream of it — repository acquisition, artifact
//! materialization, task creation — acts on what it says. Anything the receiver
//! cannot pin to a known provider contract is refused here rather than partly
//! applied later.
