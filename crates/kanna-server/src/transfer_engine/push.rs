//! duplicate-push guard is now transactional rather than a renderer snapshot
//! racing the DB — the row this process is about to write is the row it just
//! read. And the phases that must happen at most once (typing into the source

//! item cannot type the same thing twice.
//!
//! Shutting the source agent down is [`super::finalize`]'s job.
