//! The task's committed work tip, and reconciling `pipeline_item.branch` onto
//! the branch that holds it.
//!
//! A task's work does not live on one branch for its whole life: every stage
//! transition forks a fresh workspace, and a revision may adopt an older one.
//! `pipeline_item.branch` records the workspace the engine last *placed* the
//! task in — which is not, on its own, the branch holding the newest commit.
//! When a round's commit lands on a workspace that field no longer names,
//! forking the next workspace from the field silently drops it: the next
//! reviewer reads code without the previous round's fix and re-raises the
//! identical finding, so the revision budget burns without converging.
//!
//! Observed live on 2026-08-21: a resumed revision rewound `pipeline_item.branch`
//! to the implement workspace while each round's commit landed on the reviewer's
//! fork, and three consecutive review forks were cut from the same pre-revision
//! base. The regression is covered by the tests in this module.
//!
//! Which branch holds the tip is therefore a question for git, not for the run
//! records: the engine cannot see where an agent `cd`s. Every stage
//! preparation resolves the tip across all of the task's known workspaces and
//! moves the task's branch onto it before anything forks.
