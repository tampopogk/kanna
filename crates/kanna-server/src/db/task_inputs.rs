//! Durable record of messages injected into a task's agent session from
//! outside that session.
//!
//! `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/input` writes to a PTY. Until this table existed
//! the message was visible only in that live terminal: nothing on the task,
//! nothing on the `stage_run`, nothing in the event feed. Every consumer that
//! reasons from durable records — a review stage running in a forked worktree
//! with a fresh session, a dispatcher, a post-hoc audit — was structurally
//! blind to it, and could therefore "prove" from the record that an owner
//! directive it was told about had never been issued. It happened: a round-2
//! reviewer read the stage prompts and revision feedback, found no send-input,
//! and instructed the implementer to revert an owner's design directive.
//!
//! So each delivery that the daemon accepted is appended here with its text,
//! the stage and run that were live when it landed, and who delivered it. The
//! row is the evidence; the `task.input_delivered` event is only its
//! announcement.
//!
//! Scope, stated so a reader knows what an empty list does and does not mean:
//! this covers deliveries through `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/input`. Historical
//! rows may have the retired `notify` source. Stage prompts, post prompts, and
//! revision feedback are already durable on `stage_run` and are not duplicated
//! here.
