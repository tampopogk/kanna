//! Append-only task event log.
//!
//! An orchestrator agent watching N child tasks cannot use `kanna_wait_task`:
//! it blocks on one id and resolves only on finish. This log is the multi-task
//! alternative — every event a watcher needs, ordered by an opaque cursor, so a
//! caller that loops on `(cursor -> events, next cursor)` sees each event
//! exactly once and never loses one that fired between two calls.
//!
//! **Why `seq` is a safe cursor.** `seq` is `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`
//! and SQLite admits one writer at a time for the whole database: a writer
//! cannot allocate a `seq` until the previous writer has committed. There is
//! therefore no window in which a higher `seq` is visible while a lower one is
//! still uncommitted, so `WHERE seq > cursor ORDER BY seq` can never skip an
//! event. Readers additionally bound their query by a head read *before* the
//! event query, so the cursor they hand back is never ahead of what they read.
//!
//! Events are appended by the same DB calls that already change the state they
//! describe, inside the caller's transaction where there is one. That keeps the
//! log consistent with `pipeline_item`/`stage_run` by construction rather than
//! by every call site remembering to publish.
