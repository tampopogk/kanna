//! The transfer engine's durable work queue.
//!
//! The four state-mutating sidecar lifecycle events used to be delivered to a
//! renderer window from an in-memory Tauri queue. Only `transfer-request`
//! survived an app restart, via sidecar replay plus a DB sweep; the other three
//! simply died with the process. They are rows here instead, appended by the
//! same reader that observes the event, so a restart resumes them rather than
//! orphaning them.
//!
//! `id` is derived from the event rather than generated, which is what makes a
//! redelivered event collapse onto the work already queued. That is the durable
//! replacement for the sidecar's in-memory `claimed_phases` idempotency: what
//! used to be at-least-once delivery to a window is exactly-once execution in
//! one process.
