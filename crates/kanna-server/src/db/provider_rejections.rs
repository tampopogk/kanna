//! The durable record of a provider refusing a task's turn for spent quota.
//!
//! A rejection is a *positive*, provider-stated observation, and it has to
//! outlive the terminal it was printed on for the same reason a delivered task
//! input does: the session dies at the next stage boundary, and a manager
//! reading the durable record afterwards would otherwise conclude the run
//! simply failed. Worse, without a record the recovery has no memory — the
//! rerun path feeds a run's recorded provider back in as an explicit override,
//! so a task rejected on one candidate is re-pinned to that candidate forever.
//!
//! One row per stage run per stated scope. That uniqueness is the whole
//! de-duplication story: the daemon latches its own announcement per session
//! incarnation, and a replayed or re-adopted announcement lands on the same
//! row instead of a second one.
