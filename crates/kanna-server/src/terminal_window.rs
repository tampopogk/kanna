//! Bounding a terminal snapshot for a remote viewer, and the state that makes
//! the rest of the buffer reachable without re-shipping it.
//!
//! The daemon hands kanna-server one serialized terminal — the visible screen
//! *plus* up to 10,000 rows of scrollback (`crates/daemon/src/session.rs`). On
//! a phone that is the wrong unit of transfer: `7a38cc18`'s frame inventory
//! measured 1.71 MiB base64 for a plain 10,000-row scrollback and 114.8 MiB for
//! a truecolor one, and a flaky link re-ships the whole thing on every
//! reconnect.
//!
//! This module holds the three pure pieces of the fix, so they can be tested
//! without a daemon or a socket:
//!
//! - [`TerminalWindow`] — the bounded snapshot actually sent, plus the older
//!   lines retained to serve later.
//! - [`TerminalHistory`] — those retained lines, served back in bounded chunks.
//! - [`OutputRing`] — live output recorded after a snapshot, so a reconnecting
//!   client can be replayed the bytes it missed instead of the whole terminal.
//!
//! ## What a "line" is here
//!
//! The Ghostty serializer separates rows with `\r\n` and writes *no* separator
//! between a wrapped row and its continuation
//! (`ghostty-xterm-compat-serialize`, `row_end`). Splitting on `\r\n` therefore
//! yields logical lines, which is the right unit for both a scrollback window
//! and a scrollback chunk: rejoining consecutive pieces with `\r\n` reproduces
//! the original byte-for-byte.
