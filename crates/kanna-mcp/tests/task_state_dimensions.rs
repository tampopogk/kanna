//! A task carries two orthogonal facts — what its agent session is doing, and
//! whether a human has read its latest output — and `activity` blends them
//! into one display value. These tests drive the whole chain the split has to
//! hold across: a daemon fixture on the real daemon socket, a real
//! `kanna-server` (real SQLite, real HTTP surface), and a real `kanna-mcp`
//! (real stdio JSON-RPC, real catalog routing). See `common/mod.rs`.
//!
//! Two failures motivated them, both observed operationally:
//!
//! 1. A task blocked inside a long MCP call reported `unread`/`idle` while its
//!    agent was demonstrably busy, so external supervisors raised quiet alarms
//!    against running agents.
//! 2. `kanna_wait_task`'s `until: finished` resolved on `unread`, which is
//!    read state — so a wait for a task to finish could resolve on a task that
//!    was still working.
